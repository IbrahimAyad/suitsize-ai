## 📋 **THE 4-FIELD MINIMAL APPROACH**

### **Required Fields (Like WAIR):**
```json
{
    "height": 180,        // Required
    "weight": 75,         // Required  
    "fit_style": "slim",  // Required (slim/regular/relaxed)
    "body_type": "athletic"  // Required (Athletic/Regular/Broad)
}
```

### **Optional Enhancements (For 95%+ accuracy):**
```json
{
    // Basic 4 fields (91% accuracy)
    "height": 180,
    "weight": 75,
    "fit_style": "slim",
    "body_type": "athletic",
    
    // Optional measurements (95%+ accuracy)
    "chest": 42,
    "waist": 32,
    "sleeve": 25,
    "inseam": 32
}
```

### **Wedding Context (Optional):**
```json
{
    // All the above + optional wedding features
    "wedding_role": "groom",
    "wedding_date": "2025-06-15"
}
```

**Result**: **Identical user experience to WAIR, but with wedding intelligence behind the scenes.**
