  "sizing_questions": {
    "how_to_measure": {
      "question": "How do I take my measurements accurately?",
      "answer": "For the most accurate fit, we recommend professional measurements. However, you can measure yourself using a flexible tape measure. For chest: measure around the fullest part of your chest, keeping the tape horizontal. For waist: measure around your natural waistline. For height: stand straight against a wall and measure from floor to top of head.",

    "size_differences": {
      "question": "What's the difference between S, R, and L sizes?",
      "answer": "S (Short), R (Regular), and L (Long) refer to the length of the jacket and sleeves. S is for heights 5'3\"-5'8\", R is for 5'8\"-6'0\", and L is for 6'0\"-6'4\". The chest size (34, 36, 38, etc.) remains the same within each length category.",

    },
    
    "athletic_build": {
      "question": "I have an athletic build - what size should I choose?",
      "answer": "For athletic builds, we recommend sizing for your shoulders and chest, then having the waist tailored. Athletic builds typically need waist suppression and sometimes sleeve width adjustments. Our athletic fit options are designed specifically for this body type.",
      "category": "body_type",
      "frequency": "medium",
      "confidence_impact": "high"
    },
    
    "slim_build": {
      "question": "I'm slim - should I size down?",
      "answer": "Yes, slim builds often benefit from sizing down one size for better proportions. You may need sleeve width and waist adjustments for the perfect fit. Our slim fit options are designed to work well with your body type.",
      "category": "body_type",
      "frequency": "medium",
      "confidence_impact": "high"
    },
    
    "broad_build": {
      "question": "I have broad shoulders - what should I consider?",
      "answer": "For broad builds, size for your shoulders and chest, then have the waist let out if needed. You may need sleeve width adjustments for comfortable arm movement. Regular to comfort fit options work best for your build.",

      "frequency": "medium",

    }
  },
  
  "fit_questions": {
    "jacket_length": {
      "question": "How long should my suit jacket be?",
      "answer": "A well-fitted jacket should cover your seat and end at the middle of your hand when your arms are at your sides. The length should be proportional to your height and body type.",

      "confidence_impact": "medium"
    },
    
    "sleeve_length": {
      "question": "How long should my jacket sleeves be?",
      "answer": "Jacket sleeves should end at the base of your thumb, showing about 1/4 to 1/2 inch of your shirt cuff. This creates a balanced, professional appearance.",
      "category": "fit",
      "frequency": "medium",
      "confidence_impact": "medium"
    },
    
    "shoulder_fit": {
      "question": "How should the shoulders fit?",
      "answer": "The shoulder seam should sit at the edge of your shoulder, not hanging down your arm or cutting into your neck. The shoulders are the foundation of a good fit and are difficult to alter.",

      "frequency": "low",
      "confidence_impact": "high"
    },
    
    "waist_fit": {
      "question": "How fitted should the waist be?",
      "answer": "The waist should have a slight suppression for a modern look, but not be so tight that it creates wrinkles or restricts movement. You should be able to button the jacket comfortably.",
      "category": "fit",
      "frequency": "medium",
      "confidence_impact": "medium"
    }
  },

    },
    
    "alteration_limits": {

    "fit_types": {
      "question": "What's the difference between slim, regular, and comfort fit?",

      "confidence_impact": "medium"
    },
    
    "lapel_choice": {
      "question": "Which lapel width should I choose?",
      "answer": "Narrow lapels (2-2.5 inches) are modern and work well with slim fits. Standard lapels (2.5-3 inches) are classic and versatile. Wide lapels (3+ inches) are traditional and work well with broader builds.",

      "frequency": "low",
      "confidence_impact": "low"
    },
    
    "vent_choice": {
      "question": "What's the difference between side vents and center vent?",

    "confidence_meaning": {
      "question": "What does the confidence score mean?",
      "answer": "The confidence score indicates how reliable our size recommendation is based on your measurements and our customer data. High confidence (85%+) means we're very sure about the recommendation. Lower confidence suggests trying multiple sizes or professional fitting.",

    },
    
    "low_confidence": {
      "question": "Why is my confidence score low?",

      "frequency": "medium",
      "confidence_impact": "high"
    },
    
    "improving_confidence": {

      "question": "What are the most common return reasons?",

    "professional_fitting": {
      "question": "When should I get professional fitting?",
