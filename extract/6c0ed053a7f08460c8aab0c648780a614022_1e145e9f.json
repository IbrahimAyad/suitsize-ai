Body Shape Classifications of Males 26 to 35 Using Size USA Three-Dimensional Scan Data (Under the direction of Dr. Cynthia Istook.)  \n\nLiterature reviewed showed that consumers are frustrated with the lack of consistency of fit in regards to apparel.  More than half of male consumers have difficulty finding good fit in apparel.  Among the factors contributing to the fit and sizing issues found in the apparel industry are the lack of consistency in sizing across brands and a currently outdated standardized sizing system.  Current standardized sizing systems are based on averages and percentages that don’t fully capture every size and shape in the population and does not take into consideration that two consumers that are the same height and weight can have very different body shapes due to factors such as age or ethnicity.  At present, there is no ASTM sizing table available for men younger than 35 which demonstrated the void for a sizing standard that addressed the body size and shape needs for men younger than 35 years of age.  \n\nThis research provides a method for using 3D scan data to determine shape categories for the male population between the ages of 26 and 35.  Two different methods utilizing five drop values were used to determine shape clusters that identified the predominant shapes of male bodies in the US for males age 26 to 35 utilizing SizeUSA scan data.  One set of clusters was based on the shape clusters identified by a cluster analysis and the other was based on shape clusters identified using a new shape identification software developed in Microsoft Excel called MSIT (Male Shape Identification Technique) for Apparel.  Clustering the shapes using the MSIT proved to be better at identifying the various body shapes that existed than the cluster analysis.  The shape clusters identified by each method were assigned a descriptive category label.  The category labels were: Oval, Rectangle, Trapezoid, and  \n\nInverted Trapezoid.  There were subjects that could not be easily identified by the four shape categories.  There were subjects whose body measurements did not fit within the broad shape categories, in addition to subjects that fell into more than one category.  \n\nAdditionally, minimum and maximum values were identified for ASTM drop values that corresponded with the drop values generated from the SizeUSA measurement data for males age 26 to 35.  The minimum and maximum values in each ASTM drop were used to create a range for each drop.  These ranges were used in a formula to determine whether or not any of the ASTM sizing standards for males satisfied the measurement needs of the male subjects ages 26 to 35 in the SizeUSA data in each of the shape categories.  This analysis showed that there were no subjects that had all five drops satisfied by the current ASTM D6240 sizing standard for males.  \n\n© Copyright 2016 Anthony Wilson All Rights Reserved  \n\nBody Shape Classifications of Males 26 to 35 Using Size USA Three-Dimensional Scan Data  \n\nby  \n\nAnthony Frank Wilson  \n\nA dissertation submitted to the Graduate Faculty of North Carolina State University In partial fulfillment of the Requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy  \n\nTextile Technology Management  \n\nRaleigh, NC 2016  \n\nAPPROVED BY:  \n\nDr. Katherine Annett-Hitchcock  \n\nDr. Marguerite Moore Dr. Andre West  \n\nDr. Cynthia Istook Chair of Advisory Committee  \n\nDEDICATION  \n\nTo my parents,  \n\nColumbus and Mamie Wilson:  \n\nthrough the sacrifices you’ve made,   \nsupport and encouragement you’ve given,   \nand prayers you’ve lifted on my behalf,   \nI am achieving my goals.\n\nDefinition of Terms  \n\nAnthropometry: Refers to the measurement and proportions of the human body.  \n\nASTM, formerly the American Society of Testing and Materials International: A not-for-profit organization that provides a forum for the development and publication of international voluntary consensus standards for materials, products, systems, and services (ASTM.org, 2015).  \n\nCivilian American and European Surface Anthropometry Resource Project (CAESAR): A sizing study conducted to generate 3-D data to update current anthropometric databases of civilian males and females age 18-65 of a variety of shapes and sizes (http://www.sae.org/technicalcommittees/caesarhome.htm).  \n\nMass Customization: A business strategy to produce a good or service that meets a specific customer’s need while maintaining the efficiency associated with mass production (Christy, 1993; Duray, Ward, Milligan, & Berry, 2000; Jiao &Tseng, 2001; Pine, B., Davis, & Pine II, B., 1999; Pine II, B., Victor, & Boynton, 1993).  \n\nSomatotype: The category of a person’s body structure or build in relation to how fat, muscular, or lean they are (Sheldon, 1954).  \n\nEctomorph – Characterized as linear, thin, flat chested, and having lean muscles.  \n\nEndomorph – Characterized as round and soft, having a large abdominal region, stocky, and muscles are not well defined.  \n\nMesomorph – Characterized as athletic and strong, having well defined muscles.  \n\nThree Dimensional (3D) Body Scanning: In general, most 3D body scanning systems use non-invasive optical techniques and light sensitive devices to obtain body size and shape information in addition to generating a virtual model of the human body (Istook & Hwang, 2001; Treleaven & Wells, 2007).  \n\nCHAPTER 2: REVIEW OF LITERATURE  \n\nWhile there is a wealth of information and research surrounding body size and shape classifications for women, research in these areas for men is lacking.  Literature was reviewed in the following areas:  \n\nFit and Sizing Issues   \nFigure classification for males   \nBody evaluation techniques   \nBody shape and age   \nThree dimensional body scanning technology   \nData analysis techniques  \n\nFit and Sizing Issues  \n\nApparel fit is an area of major concern for apparel industry professionals and consumers alike.  One industry study reported that $62\\%$ of male consumers have difficulty finding good fit in apparel (LaBat, & Delong, 1990; DesMarteau, 2000; Chattaraman, Simmons, & Ulrich, 2013).  This dissatisfaction contributes to loss revenue in retail sales of apparel and apparel products (LaBat, 2007).  There are a variety of factors that contribute to the fit and sizing issues found in the apparel industry.  Among these factors are the lack of consistency in sizing across brands and a currently outdated standardized sizing system.  \n\nResearch has shown that consumers are frustrated with the lack of consistency of fit across apparel brands (Staples, 1995; Sindicich, & Black, 2011).  It is common for consumers to find good fit with a size medium in one brand but will find if necessary to go up or down a size for the same garment in another brand.  Retailers and manufacturers have not all adopted one standard method of sizing apparel, instead many attempt to appeal to consumer’s egos opting to attach a smaller size label to a larger garment as a strategy used to boost sales by helping consumers feel better about themselves when they’re able to wear a smaller size (Goldsberry, 1994; DesMarteau, 2000).  \n\nBrands such as Gap and Levi Strauss have attempted to address sizing issues in the sale of their jeans.  Many of the style category names used by both brands give consumers an indication of how a particular jean style is going to fit in a fashion sense.  In addition to providing descriptive style category names such as Skinny, Slim, Bootcut, Straight, Relaxed, and Standard, these brands also provide consumers with additional general information regarding the fit of each style category (see Table 1) (http://www.gap.com/; http://www.levi.com/US/en_US/). While the fit of each style category is described relative to the body (size and shape) that the garment has been designed for, it does not identify what the perfect measurements would be to achieve that fit.  \n\nTable 1.

A study by Ruth O’Brien and William Shelton in 1941 was used as a basis for a commercial standard which led to the development of the American Society of Testing and Materials International (ASTM) apparel sizing system currently used for women in the US today (O’Brien & Shelton, 1941; Devarajan, 2003).  This sizing system was developed to assist in grouping the most commonly occurring human body sizes into categories.  Because this system was based on a study comprised primarily of young Caucasian women in the 1940s, it is not a true representation of every body size, shape, and proportion that was present in the entire population in regards to demographic factors such as age and race in the 1940s and likewise does not represent the differences present in body size, shape, and proportion in the current population due to the demographic changes that have occurred within the past 74 years (Ashdown, & Dunne, 2006;  Devarajan, 2003; Giovis, 2007; Simmons, 2002; Simmons, & Ulrich, 2013).  In addition, the grade rules for the current standards are based on averages and percentages that don’t fully capture every size and shape in the population and does not take into consideration that two consumers that are the same height and weight can have very different body shapes.  \n\nThe limited literature regarding the fit and sizing in men’s apparel indicates that standardized sizing for men evolved from measurements taken of soldiers during the American Civil War for the mass production of military uniforms (http://museum.nist.gov/exhibits/apparel/ history.htm; [TC]², 2004; Zernike, 2004).  Because of the racial climate prevalent during this time period and the fact that measurements were obtained from soldiers, it is safe to assume that much like the female study conducted in\n\nBIOGRAPHY  \n\nAnthony Frank Wilson, son of Columbus Frank and Mamie (Rowe) Wilson, was born on September 22, 1973, in Taylorsville, North Carolina.  He graduated from Alexander Central High School in Taylorsville, North Carolina in 1991.  He then attended and graduated from Appalachian State University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Clothing and Textiles with a minor in Marketing in 1997.  After obtaining his undergraduate degree, he worked for several years in the apparel industry with Sag Harbor Dresses (New York, NY) as a production pattern assistant, Liancarlo (Miami, FL) as a creative design assistant/ fabric purchaser, Andasimo (New York) as a technical designer, and Taylor Togs (Micaville, NC) as a sample coordinator.  He has created a variety of commissioned design works for various occasions and has collaborated with companies as a freelance designer.  Through his freelance work with Heatherette, Anthony was provided the opportunity to create designs that have been in magazines and worn by singing artists such as Pink, Brittany Spears, and Shirley Manson.  Through his freelance work with Golden Age Motorcycles, he had the opportunity to create a motorcycle jacket for singer Billy Joel.  \n\nIn 2006, after returning to Appalachian State University and graduating with a Master of Science degree in Graphics and Imaging Technology, he opened a custom clothing design business called Anthony Wilson Designs, Inc.  In 2009, in addition to his responsibilities with his design business, Anthony was offered the opportunity, via a nine month appointment position, to teach Textile and Apparel Merchandising courses at Appalachian State University.  This position proved to be a rewarding experience that led to Anthony enrolling in the Textile Technology Management doctoral program at North Carolina State University. While enrolled in the doctoral program, he worked as the graduate teaching assistant to his advisor, Dr. Cynthia Istook, who encouraged him to become an active member of the International Textile and Apparel Association (ITAA) and to submit creative design works to various competitions for which he has received awards.  Before graduating, Anthony began teaching full time at Appalachian State University in the Apparel Design and Merchandising program.  In addition to his teaching responsibilities, Anthony continues to attend conferences and workshops to stay current with new technologies and techniques related to the apparel industry.  \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  \n\nIt is with great pleasure that I acknowledge and thank those who have helped me throughout this research process both professionally and personally.  \n\n  I would like to thank my advisory committee for the guidance and valuable feedback they’ve provided throughout the research and writing process:  \n\nDr. Cynthia Istook (Chair of my advisory committee):  I do not have the words to adequately express how grateful I am to have you as my advisor and mentor.

Regardless of the apparel items being produced, even the simplest garment can require the need to obtain multiple measurements.  Knowledge of the dimensions of the bust/chest, waist, and hip are common for most garment production but in many cases additional information such as arm length, upper arm circumference, thigh circumference, waist to knee length, high hip circumference, or low hip circumference are required to achieve proper fit.  Obtaining this information is an initial step in producing garments that fit properly.  \n\nIn the past, dressmakers and/or tailors or consumers themselves would utilize the aforementioned information to achieve custom fit in clothing.  As technological advances were made, apparel shifted from custom clothing for the individual to the method of mass production which provides clothing for the masses based on a standardized sizing system (Bye, DeLong, & Labat, 2006).  Anthropometric studies conducted in 1941 for the purposes of producing military uniforms for World War II were used by the mail order apparel industry as a basis for establishing a sizing system to assist in grouping the most commonly occurring human body sizes into categories (O’Brien & Shelton, 1941).  A downfall of the standardized sizing system used in the apparel industry is that it does not represent every body size and shape in the entire population nor does it represent the differences present in body size, shape, and proportion due to the demographic changes that have occurred in the population within the past 74 years (Ashdown, & Dunne, 2006; Giovis, 2007; Simmons, 2002; Simmons, & Ulrich, 2013).  \n\nThe United Kingdom, The United States, Mexico, Korea, Thailand, and various other countries have conducted sizing surveys utilizing 3D scanning technology in addition to manual anthropometric measurements in an attempt to provide industry professionals with more accurate information regarding the size and shape of consumers (Deschamps, 2011; Lee, Istook, Nam, & Park, 2007; Shin, & Istook, 2007).  Three dimensional scanning and the information it provides has been utilized and referenced in a wealth of studies conducted regarding body analysis and apparel fit for womenswear, however, there has been little to no significant research regarding body analysis and apparel fit for menswear (Chattaraman, Simmons, & Ulrich, 2013).  \n\nRationale  \n\nResearch has shown that consumers are frustrated with the lack of consistency of fit across apparel brands (Staples, 1995).  More than half of male consumers have difficulty finding good fit in apparel (DesMarteau, 2000; Chattaraman, Simmons, & Ulrich, 2013). Among the factors contributing to the fit and sizing issues found in the apparel industry are the lack of consistency in sizing across brands and a currently outdated standardized sizing system.  Current standardized sizing systems are based on averages and percentages that don’t fully capture every size and shape in the population and do not take into consideration that two consumers that are the same height and weight can have very different body shapes due to factors such as age, ethnicity, heredity, or health and fitness.  \n\nThis research will provide a method for using 3D scan data to determine shape categories for the US male population between the ages of 26 and 35.  Men in this age range make up approximately $14\\%$ of the US male population and earn an annual median income of upwards of $\\mathbb{S}50{,}000$ (http://census.gov/library/publications/2016/demo/p60-256.html).  \n\nThis market segment contributed to the $\\mathbb{S}125.6$ billion of revenue generated in the US menswear market in 2014 and is predicted to increase to $\\mathbb{S}147.9$ billion by 2019 (http://www.marketresearch.com/MarketLine-v3883/Menswear-United-States-9043151/).  \n\nThe current ASTM sizing table is for mature men 35 years of age or older (https://www.astm.org/Standards/D6240.htm).  At present, there is no ASTM sizing table available for men younger than 35 demonstrating the void for a sizing standard that addresses the body size and shape needs for men 26 to 35 years of age.  Comparing the information generated in this study to current sizing standards will result in providing information to assist in meeting the needs of male consumers ages 26 to 35 more proficiently.  \n\nResearch Objectives  \n\nThe objective of this research was to determine male body shape classifications for men ages 26 to 35 utilizing 3D scan data.  While there is research regarding female body shape classifications, research regarding men’s body shape classifications are lacking.  This research will assist in establishing a baseline for further studies in this area.  \n\nSpecific research questions include:  \n\n1.  Can SizeUSA data collected for men be used to identify the predominant shapes of male bodies in the US for men ages 26 to 35?   \n2.  Based on literature review and the visual properties of the bodies within each shape, can a descriptive label be identified that would aid in an understanding of the shape differentiators?  \n\n3.  Does the ASTM D6240 sizing system developed for males meet the measurement needs of the male subjects age 26 to 35 from the SizeUSA sizing survey?  \n\nStudy Limitations  \n\nThis study will be limited by the following factors:  \n\n1.  Measurement data used in this study was from the SizeUSA 3D scanning survey completed in 2003.  However, it is the most current and largest sizing survey conducted in the United States to date.   \n2.  Without expert human intervention, measurements extracted from 3D body scans may not be obtained at the exact location on the body, as would be necessary for accurate comparisons.  This is an issue because the computer software does not have the tacit knowledge or the physical ability to determine specific body landmarks that might be hidden or indeterminate by muscle, fat, or other inhibitors.   \n3.  SizeUSA 3D data does not include stomach and abdomen measurements for male subjects.  \n\nAssumptions  \n\nThe following assumptions will be made:  \n\n1.  The SizeUSA data obtained from $[\\mathrm{TC}]^{2}$ scanners has an accuracy within an 1/8” when the measurements have been obtained at the correct location on the body. 2.  Size USA point cloud images generated from 3D scan data accurately represent the predominant shapes of the male population in the US.\n\n1941, these male sizing standards are comprised primarily of young Caucasian male soldiers resulting in body size, shape, and proportion information that did not represent the entirety of the population of its time nor does it represent the differences present in body size, shape, and proportion in the current population due to the demographic changes that have occurred since the 1800s.  \n\nIn an attempt to gain more current anthropometric data there have been a variety of sizing surveys conducted in the United Kingdom, the United States, Mexico, Korea, and Thailand utilizing 3D scanning technology in addition to manual anthropometric measurements (Deschamps, 2011; Lee, Istook, Nam, & Park, 2007; Shin, & Istook, 2007). The CAESAR study, a sizing study organized and conducted by the Society of Automotive Engineers and the U.S. Air Force from 1998 to early 2000, utilized 3D scanning technology to collect anthropometric data from a diverse sample of men and women, ages 18 to 65 of various sizes and shapes.  The sample consisted of 2,500 subjects from the United States and 2,500 subjects from Europe.  Data collection methods were standardized to ensure the database could be consistently updated and expanded  \n\n(http://www.sae.org/technicalcommittees/caesarhome.htm, 2015; [TC]², 2004).  \n\nAnother study, the SizeUSA National Sizing Survey, partially funded by the U.S. Department of Commerce and additionally supported by apparel industry companies, the Army, Navy, and academic universities, was organized and conducted by $\\mathrm{[TC]}^{2}$ from 2002 to 2003 utilizing white light 3D scanning technology (more emphasis will be placed on this study because the data obtained on its males subjects will be used to address the research objectives of this paper).  The purpose of the SizeUSA survey was to obtain more current anthropometric data of the U.S. population that was not possible previously because of the  \n\ntime and cost associated with taking on such a task manually. A sample was selected consisting of over 10,000 adults of which approximately $37\\%$ were men and $63\\%$ were women from 13 U.S. cities.  The sampling strategy used modelled approximate height and weight distribution of a previously valid study by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III.  Prior to being scanned, subjects completed a questionnaire that identified their age, sex, ethnicity, zip code, annual household income, marital status, body structure, lifestyle, education, employment, preferred clothing sizes, preferred stores, and types of clothing worn ([TC]², 2004; Zernike, 2004).
