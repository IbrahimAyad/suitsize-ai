Faust and S. Carrier  \n\nThis page intentionally left blank  \n\nThe last 20 years have seen a tremendous amount of work being done in the f ield of anthropometry and sizing of clothing. The need for f inding solutions to the problem of garment sizing has been recognized for a long time but the sheer magnitude of time, human resource and money required to conduct anthropometric surveys acted as a deterrent. The remarkable technological developments of the last decade, particularly in the area of automated body scanning, have made the conduct of large scale surveys feasible in terms of time and funds required. They have greatly enhanced the domain of information available in terms of body volume, posture and shape which could not be obtained from the manual methods. These have been accompanied by concomitant developments in the f ield of image analysis. Together, these have taken the research and development activity in the f ield of anthropometry and garment sizing to hitherto unknown levels of advancement.  \n\nAlthough garment designers have historically used body measurements as a basis for development of body blocks, most knowledge in the f ield has been generated empirically and has no scientif ic basis. It is for this reason that the conventional size charts do not yield a satisfactory f it of garments for a large section of the target population. Garment designers have very little knowledge of the principles of anthropometry or for that matter ergonomics. With the focus of industry shifting rapidly from fashion clothing to high tech and high value added functional clothing, the need to understand and appreciate the basics of ergonomics as well as anthropometry, has become critical for all present and future designers. In clothing design, as in all f ields of design, the concept of inclusive design is gaining popularity. This concept is based on the premise of understanding the differences between the shape, size, strength, activities and the psychological requirements of various divergent groups present in a population. It is about designing products based on their specif ic requirements rather than designing for the normal or the average. Since clothing is an intimate part of the human body, application of the principles of ergonomic design can greatly enhance the performance as well as eff iciency of clothing and related products for all members of a population. Anthropometry, apparel sizing and design are important elements in manufacturing quality clothing products. The contents of this book deal with topics that are relevant for production of well f itting garments. It details the comprehensive process of sizing system development beginning from the collection of human data, which is the anthropometric survey, to the statistical analysis of the anthropometric data for a concrete sizing system and then the importance of designing the clothing incorporating the f it of different body shapes. This book was conceived with the idea of providing a state of the art treatise on the subject of anthropometry and its applications to the design and sizing of clothing for the designers and manufacturers of clothing and related products. There are several steps involved in the development of a sizing system. The process begins by design and conduct of an anthropometric survey; the next step involves data validation and data analysis. Several statistical tools and sophisticated data mining techniques can be used to analyse and classify the data to identify the basic shapes and sizes of bodies existing in a population. Image analysis techniques are used where the anthropometric data are available in the form of 3D scans; special techniques are used to analyse the size data of special population groups as part of the inclusive design approach; testing and analysis of f it of clothing in static as well as mobile mode is performed to validate the sizing systems; f inally, the process ends by standardization of the apparel sizes and development of a logical size designation and labelling system for communicating the size information to the user. This book deals with all the above topics and brings to the reader the historical perspective as well as the latest research in the f ield of garment sizing with a glimpse of the exciting developments which are bound to change the way bodies will be measured and analysed and how in turn, garments will be designed in future.  \n\nThe editors would like to thank all the authors for contributing valuable chapters to this book. Thanks are also due to Francis Dodds, Lucy Beg and Kate Hardcastle of Woodhead Publishing Limited for seeing the publication through to its logical completion.  \n\nDeepti Gupta and Norsaadah Zakaria\n\nThis page intentionally left blank  \n\nApparel sizing: existing sizing systems and the development of new sizing systems  \n\nN.

GUPTA,  Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, India DOI: 10.1533/9780857096890.1.3  \n\nAbstract: The chapter begins by discussing the importance of a sizing system for clothing and reviewing the existing sizing systems that have been developed from 1941 to 2012. A comprehensive compilation of sizing systems based on the techniques is discussed, each according to its strengths and weakness. Next, this chapter demonstrates the development of a sizing system combining statistical methods and data mining techniques, illustrated with a f lowchart. The last two sections brief ly discuss future trends in selecting key dimensions and list additional sources of information and advice.  \n\nKey words:  anthropometric data, sizing systems, ready- to-wear clothing, clustering, data analysis, data mining.  \n\n1.1 Introduction  \n\nClothing is a necessity in human life, and it is important to wear the right size clothes so that they are comfortable and f it the body well. During the early eighteenth century all clothing was custom- made, each garment hand- sewn for a particular individual. This custom- made clothing exactly f it the individual’s body size and shape. Various sizing methods were employed by the dressmakers and craftsmen of the time, but problems in sizing did not really exist because each item was tailored according to an individual’s needs.   However, starting from the middle of the 1700s, there rose a demand for clothing to be mass- produced. 1 The demand started with military uniforms, which needed to be available in bulk. Mass- produced clothes are based on pre- assigned sizes according to classif ied groups, and are known as ready- to-wear (RTW); this is the type of clothing which is sold at retail stores. Starting in the 1940s, RTW garments began to be popular in retail stores and increasingly demanded by customers. 1 This was a change in clothing buying trends, from getting a garment tailored to buying it off the rack. Because RTW clothing was based on average sizes, people with different body variations and ranges often had problems f inding clothing to f it them. This was the origin of the need for a standard sizing system, since RTW resulted in many returns to stores and mail- order houses due to ill- f itting clothing.  \n\n1.2 Existing sizing systems: strengths and weaknesses  \n\nTable 1.1  summarizes a comprehensive collection of literature on all the sizing systems that have been developed by researchers all over the world from 1941 to 2012. This summary has been carefully researched and obtained from the journal literature and compiled in order to give a good background for those who want to develop additional sizing systems.  \n\nSizing systems have been developed and improved throughout the years using more and more sophisticated methods: simple mathematical techniques such as bivariate  classif ication;  statistical  techniques  like  correlation  coeff icients; multivariate techniques, namely principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis; programming techniques like linear programming (LP) and integer programming and non- linear optimization; data mining techniques such as cluster and decision tree analysis; and artif icial intelligence techniques including genetic algorithms, neural networks, fuzzy logic and self- organization methods (SOM). All these techniques are brief ly described in the following paragraphs to show the range of techniques available for sizing system development.  \n\nReferring to  Table 1.1 , the f irst recorded sizing analysis was performed in 1941 and it applied bivariate classif ication to cluster women according to bust and hip girth. Before this time, the classif ication of body types was based on height and weight. 2  Thirty years later, other researchers applied the same technique (bivariate classif ication) to develop sizing systems for different target populations. 3,4  In her studies, Otieno 4 identif ied areas of f it problems such as bust and waist girth and hip and leg length. After selecting the key dimensions, she classif ied children into sizes, f irst according to the primary key dimension of height and then according to the secondary dimensions of bust for upper body garments and height and hip for lower body garments.  \n\nIn 1985, Salusso  et al.   developed a sizing system known as PCSS (principal component sizing system) using the PCA technique. However, their application of PCA differed from that of O’Brien and Shelton.  In previous research, PCA was applied to reduce the data and then the components were analyzed for the selection of only one key dimension from each component. But in Salusso’s   research, PCA was applied to the classif ication of the population. Here, the relationship of variables is looked upon in terms of the loading of factors of those variables on each component (correlation between a variable and a component). If the loading is high, it means that the variable is strongly associated with the component. This sizing analysis showed that two components were most important, namely PC1 as laterality, associated mainly with body girth, arcs and widths, and PC2 as linearity, associated with heights and lengths. PCCS is based on partitioning the PC1 and PC2 geometrically.   PC1 and PC2 behave like the control dimensions in conventional sizing system construction. The height and weight distribution are used to identify the PCCS sizes. It was concluded that PCSS represents a better  \n\nTable 1.1 Development of sizing system literature   \n\nAuthor TitleYearSamplesMethodO'Brien,R.and Shelton,W.Women's measurementsforgarment andpattern construction.Washington,DC: US Dept of Agriculture194110041 adult femalesPCA/bivariate classification of body typesStaples, M.and DeLury, D.A system for the sizing of women's garments.

Incorporated in England by a Royal Charter granted in 1925, the Institute has individual and corporate members in over 90 countries. The aim of the Institute is to facilitate learning, recognise achievement, reward excellence and disseminate information within the global textiles, clothing and footwear industries.  \n\nHistorically, The Textile Institute has published books of interest to its members and the textile industry. To maintain this policy, the Institute has entered into partnership with Woodhead Publishing Limited to ensure that Institute members and the textile industry continue to have access to high calibre titles on textile science and technology.  \n\nMost Woodhead titles on textiles are now published in collaboration with The Textile Institute. Through this arrangement, the Institute provides an Editorial Board which advises Woodhead on appropriate titles for future publication and suggests possible editors and authors for these books. Each book published under this arrangement carries the Institute’s logo.  \n\nWoodhead books published in collaboration with The Textile Institute are offered to Textile Institute members at a substantial discount. These books, together with those published by The Textile Institute that are still in print, are offered on the  Elsevier  web  site  at:   http://store.elsevier.com/.   Textile  Institute  books still in print are also available directly from the Institute’s web site at:  www. textileinstitutebooks.com .  \n\nA list of Woodhead books on textiles science and technology, most of which have been published in collaboration with the Textile Institute, can be found towards the end of the contents pages.  \n\nAnthropometry, apparel sizing and design  \n\nEdited by  \n\nDeepti Gupta and Norsaadah Zakaria  \n\nThe Textile Institute  \n\nPublished by Woodhead Publishing Limited in association with The Textile Institute   \nWoodhead Publishing is an imprint of Elsevier   \n80 High Street, Sawston, Cambridge, CB22 3HJ, UK   \n225 Wyman Street, Waltham, MA 02451, USA   \nLangford Lane, Kidlington, OX5 1GB, UK  \n\nCopyright $\\copyright$ 2014 Woodhead Publishing Limited.
