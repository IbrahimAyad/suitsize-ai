GUIDE TO A PERFECT MEN’S SUIT FIT 
We value quality and perfection. We know that every man is different. Your size, posture, figure, and the 
shape of your body all change the way your suit fits. This is why we have prepared a comprehensive 
guide to help you take the perfect measurements for your bespoke suit. 
We know that taking measurements can be a chore, so we have worked hard to make it as easy and 
quickly as possible for you.  
 
What you will need: 
 A fabric measuring tape (fabric only). 
 Assistance from a friend 
 A well fitting suit, shirt, pair of trousers (not jeans), and a pair of shoes.  
 
 
When taking measurements: 
 Keep the measuring tape comfortably snug, but not tight. 
 All measurements should be made to nearest inch / centimeter. 
 
The following sections provide instructions on how you can create your own perfect bespoke suit. These 
three (3) measurement methods are completely different from each other but should yield the same 
result.  The steps within each of these methods are not to be interchanged: 
 SUIT MEASUREMENT METHOD. Measure your best fitting suit.  “RECOMMENDED ” 
o Measure the suit the fits you well and enter the suit measurements through the control panel. 
 BODY MEASUREMENT METHOD. Measure your body.  
o Ask someone to take your own measurements then create your body measurements profile 
online. Many customers get this wrong the first time, so if you do not have experience doing 
this, please use “Suit Measurements Method”. 
 Send us your best fitting suit.

Body Measurements  
(Ask a friend for help or have your local tailor measure you based on our guide. Please note that our tailor will 
need to add allowances to your body measurements depending on your body profile.) 
 1. NECK 
Measure around the lower part of your neck, 
placing a finger between the tape measure and 
the neck. You should not feel restricted by the 
tape for a comfortable fit, and should be able to 
put your index finger inside the tape. 
 2. CHEST 
Measure around the fullest part of the chest. 
The measuring tape is usually around the 
nipple level, under the armpits, and over your 
shoulder blades. Do not overinflate your chest 
but stand normally; you should be able to fit 
your index finger in between the tape and your 
chest. 
Note: Allowances are added when actual body measurements 
are provided. These certain allowances are based on the fit 
selected at order time: 
- Slim fit : we add 10 cm to the hip, waist (stomach) and chest 
measurements you provided (for the jacket/blazer), in order to 
give you room to move about. Depending on your body type 
sleeve length and jacket length are tailored almost exactly to 
your measurements. While adjustments to the armhole and 
sleeve width/bicep are determined after comparing shoulder and 
chest measurements. 
- Normal fit : we add 12 cm to the hip, waist (stomach) and chest 
measurements you provided (for the jacket/blazer), to achieve 
extra room while maintaining that sharp tailored look. Depending 
on your body type sleeve length and jacket length are tailored 
almost exactly to your measurements. While adjustments to the 
armhole and sleeve width/bicep are determined after comparing 
shoulder and chest measurements. 
- Loose fit : we add 15 cm to the hip, waist (stomach) and chest 
measurements you provided (for the jacket/blazer). Depending 
on your body type sleeve length and jacket length are tailored 
almost exactly to your measurements. While adjustments to the 
armhole and sleeve width/bicep are determined after comparing 

shoulder and chest measurements. This fit is more appropriate 
for less slim gentlemen. 
Note: We do not add the extra measures indicated above 
(except for shrinkage and tolerance allowance) when you take 
measurements from your best fitting shirt or suit.  
 3. STOMACH 
Measure around the widest part of your 
abdomen, placing a finger between your body 
and the tape. Make sure the tape is at the 
same height at all times. The widest part of the 
abdomen usually coincides with the belly 
button. Do not hold your stomach in. 
Note: Allowances are added when actual body measurements 
are provided. These certain allowances are based on the fit 
selected at order time: 
- Slim fit : we add 10 cm to the hip, waist (stomach) and chest 
measurements you provided (for the jacket/blazer), in order to 
give you room to move about. Depending on your body type 
sleeve length and jacket length are tailored almost exactly to 
your measurements. While adjustments to the armhole and 
sleeve width/bicep are determined after comparing shoulder and 
chest measurements.

for less slim gentlemen. 
Note: We do not add the extra measures indicated above 
(except for shrinkage and tolerance allowance) when you take 
measurements from your best fitting shirt or suit.  

 4. WAIST 
Wearing trousers and a shirt put the measuring 
tape around your waist at the height were you 
would wear your pants and adjust to your 
designed snugness with room for a finger. 
Make sure the tape is snug and does not ride 
over the waistband but you should be able to 
put your index finger inside the tape.  
 
As a guide, this measurement will be about 2 
inches above what you take off-the-rack as 
they like to flatter, but unfortunately we need 
real measurements. 
 5. HIPS 
Wearing trousers, measure around the fullest 
part of your hips, placing a finger between your 
body and the tape. Make sure the tape is 
straight at all times. 
Make sure your pockets are empty and the 
tape is not restrictive. As a guide, you should 
not make the tape too snug. You only just be 
able to feel the tape when measuring. 
Note: Allowances are added when actual body measurements 
are provided. These certain allowances are based on the fit 
selected at order time: 
- Slim fit : we add 10 cm to the hip, waist (stomach) and chest 
measurements you provided (for the jacket/blazer), in order to 
give you room to move about. Depending on your body type 
sleeve length and jacket length are tailored almost exactly to 
your measurements. While adjustments to the armhole and 
sleeve width/bicep are determined after comparing shoulder and 
chest measurements.

measurements you provided (for the jacket/blazer). Depending 
on your body type sleeve length and jacket length are tailored 
almost exactly to your measurements. While adjustments to the

shoulder and chest measurements. This fit is more appropriate 
for less slim gentlemen. 

Note: We do not add the extra measures indicated above 
(except for shrinkage and tolerance allowance) when you take 
measurements from your best fitting shirt or suit.  
 6. SHOULDER 
Measure across the top of the shoulder from 
one edge to the other. Ensure you take the 
curved contour over the top of the shoulders as 
shown.  
Wearing your best fitted shirt or suit measure 
up to the shoulder seams. 
 7. JACKET LENGTH 
Measure from the highest part of your shoulder 
(where shoulder and neck seams meet) all the 
way down to the desired length, usually around 
the thumb joint. When measuring, adopt an 
upright position with both arms on your sides. 
A shorter, trendier length, looks good when 
coupled with jeans, but is an acquired taste in 
a suit. 
 8. SLEEVE LENGTH 
Wearing a shirt that you like, measure with arm 
at your side, from the shoulder's seam all 
along the arm until you find the desired length. 
Your measurement will be the length of your 
jacket sleeve.  
We recommend that the sleeve should go to 
the base of your thumb (located at the wrist 
joint). 

 9. BICEP 
Measure around your upper arm at the widest 
point when flexed leaving one finger of space 
to take the measure. 
 10.  WRIST 
Measure around your wrist bone leaving one 
finger of space to take the measure. 
 11.  CROTCH 
Measure from the top middle of the back pants 
waist (see point A) all along the crotch seam 
through your legs until the top of front waist 
(see point B)  
 
Important: If you have any doubt, compare this 
measure with pants that fit you well. 

 12.  THIGH WIDTH 
Wearing trousers, empty your pockets then, 
Start at the top of your inseam, measure 
around your thigh with room for a finger. 
 
 13.  PANTS LENGTH 
Measure from the top of pants waist all along 
the side pant seam until the bottom of your 
pants or roughly 1 inch from the ground. 
 14.  INSEAM 
Measure from the lowest part of your crotch 
area to the floor.  
Make sure the tape is tight along the inside of 
your leg, that you are standing straight, and 
then measure.  
No shoes please ! 

 15.  KNEE 
Measure around your knee at its widest point.  
You need only measure one knee. 
 16.  HALF HEM 
Measure the width you want for the bottom of 
your trousers. 
Note: Allowances are added when actual body measurements are provided. These certain allowances are based on the 
fit selected at order time:
