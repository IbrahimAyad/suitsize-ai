Excessive weight and obesity are defined as “...abnormal and\nexcessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health ”(WHO.int, 2020 ). The body mass\nindex (BMI), which is an important indicator of chronic diseases, including diabetes,\ncardiovascular diseases and cancer ( WHO.int, 2020 ), is used to measure whether one is\noverweight (BMI of 25 and below 30) or obese (BMI of 30 and above).\nExcessive weight causes significant body changes and clothing fit problems for\noverweight and obese (OWOB) women for two reasons: (1) The amounts of fat deposited on\nparticular body areas (e.g. bust, waist, thigh) are significantly higher than on non-OWOB\nwomen ( Johnston et al. , 1988 ), and (2) although plus-size women ’s clothing is a $21 billionOverweight\nand obese\nwomen ’s body\nshape and fit\nFunding: The work was supported by the Incentive Grants (2018-2019) funded by College of Liberal Arts\nand Human Sciences at Virginia Tech.The current issue and full text archive of this journal is available on Emerald Insight at:\nhttps://www.emerald.com/insight/1361-2026.htm\nReceived 29 September 2020\nRevised 13 January 2021\n20 June 2021\n18 September 2021\nAccepted 10 November 2021\nJournal of Fashion Marketing and\nManagement: An International\nJournal\n© Emerald Publishing Limited\n1361-2026\nDOI 10.1108/JFMM-09-2020-0213\n\nindustry, few apparel companies focus on plus-sized female consumers ( Meyersohn, 2018 )\ndespite the significantly large number of OWOB adults in the US thus, exploring the\ncharacteristics of OWOB adults ’body shapes would help improve the sizing system and new\nproduct development process for larger women.\nSome studies have shown the relations between excessive fat accumulation and changes\nin body geometry and posture ( Berriganet et al., 2006 ;Fabris De Souza et al., 2005 ).Berriganet\net al. (2006) found that obesity caused postural instability that constrained goal-directed\nmovements and daily activities, such as “...upper limb movements performed from an\nupright standing position ”(p. 1,750). Further, morbidly obese individuals usually have\nscoliosis and increased thoracic kyphosis and hyperlordosis, which cause anteversion of the\nhead. Given the changes in body shapes (BSs) fat accumulation causes, OWOB female\nconsumers ’BSs differ from the BS that has been used to create the sizing standard in the\nfashion industry. However, there is the lack of understanding of OWOB female ’\nanthropometric characteristics and BSs ( Park and Park, 2013 ).\nWith limited studies on fit problems in clothing in general among larger women, researchers\nfocused on investigating fit problems in specific clothing categories, such as intimate wear\n(Bishop et al., 2018 ), swimwear ( Christel and O ’Donnell, 2016 ) and exercise apparel ( Greenleaf\net al.,2 0 2 0 ). OWOB females ’inability to find clothing that fits well often makes them feel they\nare socially inferior because of the unequal accessibility to clothing that fits well ( Bishop et al.,\n2018), and thus they may feel frustrated and rejected by the fashion industry ( Otieno et al., 2005 ;\nScaraboto and Fischer, 2013 ). Furthermore, individuals who experienced poor fit tend to have\nmore negative body image and greater body dissatisfaction than those with greater fit\nsatisfaction ( LaBat and DeLong, 1990 ). Hence, apparel companies have considered improving\ntheir size standards that affect OWOB female consumers ’self-identity and social status ( Bishop\net al.,2 0 1 8 ). For example, leading retailers (e.g. Walmart, Nike and Adidas) developed and sold\nplus-sized lines for size inclusivity ( Ashley, 2020 ). However, because there have been limited\nstudies attempting to understand BSs related fit problems in clothing in general among larger\nwomen, improving fit for OWOB women has not been an easy task for apparel companies. This,\na continuous effort on the part of fashion companies, is needed to extend beyond size inclusivity\nby attempting to understand larger BSs.\nTo help fashion companies provide their OWOB female consumers with improved fit and\nsizes, identifying their whole BS considering upper and lower bodies together would be an\nimportant step to determine the reasons why they experience ill-fitting clothes. OWOB femaleconsumers ’difficulties with fit and size may be attributable to the fact that their BSs differ\nfrom the standardized BS used to make sizing charts in the current fashion industry\n(Sokolowski et al., 2020 ). However, researchers have conducted several studies to understand\nthe BSs of females in the US ( Song and Ashdown, 2011 ) and larger females in South Korea\n(\nPark and Park, 2013 ).Song and Ashdown (2011) provided data on a wide BMI range of\nwomen ’s body measurements between BMIs of 16.2 and 34.1 (aged between 18 and 35) that\nwere included to identify the lower BS of women. Thus, their results cannot be applicable to\nOWOB women ’s BSs because they included underweighted and normal weighted women.\nFurther, a person ’s whole body is not limited to the lower body, but consists of the upper and\nlower bodies combined. For example, a woman can have a curvy lower body with a thin upper\nbody, while another can have both a curvy lower and upper body. These two should not be\ncategorized into the same whole BS. Although Park and Park (2013) categorized BSs among\nlarger women in South Korea, their results also cannot be generalized for use with OWOB\nwomen in the US because females ’body proportions are different between the US and South\nKorea ( Leeet al., 2007 ). To address these gaps, the purpose of this study was to categorize the\nwhole BSs of OWOB females in the US and examine apparel fit based on the current ASTM\nsizing standards related to the BSs categorized. In the initial stage of identifying the whole BS,\nit is necessary to include OWOB women in a wide age range, from 18 to 55 years. Thus, weJFMM\n\nused the SizeUSA database, “...a large representative database of measurements of US\nwomen ”(Song and Ashdown, 2011 , p. 916), and included data on OWOB women with a BMI\nof 25 or over aged between 18 and 55 years to address the following two research questions:\nRQ1. What are the representative whole BSs among OWOB females in the US?\nRQ2. How accurately do the current ASTM sizing standards reflect the whole BSs\nidentified among OWOB females in the US?\nThis study ’s implications include the fact that understanding the whole BSs among\nOWOB female consumers will help fashion com panies update sizing charts to meet their\ncustomers ’needs for various BSs not limited to hourglass and standardized BSs among\nconsumers with normal weight. Consequently, this will benefit both OWOB female\nconsumers and fashion companies: Consumers may have fewer fit and size problems that\ncause them to feel socially inferior, while apparel companies will receive economic\nbenefits with fewer returns and exchanges c aused by problems with ill-fitting clothes\n(Faust and Carrier, 2010 ).\nLiterature review\nOverweight, obese and fat distribution\nThere are two types of fat distribution in obesity: The android and gynoid shapes ( Vague,\n1956). The android shape is referred to as upper or central obesity ( Lefebvre et al., 1997 ). This\nshape has a waist-to-hip ratio (WHR; an indicator used to measure fat distribution around the\nwaist, Ashwell, 2009 ) greater than 0.8 with excessive subcutaneous fat accumulated\nparticularly on the trunk. The gynoid shape is defined as gluteo-femoral obesity, in which\none ’s WHR is less than 0.8 with excessive fat in the abdominal visceral area. It is also referred\nto as gynoid obesity or lower obesity and is observed primarily in women.\nAshwell (2009) introduced the Ashwell®Shape Chart that shows the relation between\nwaist measurements and height and categorizes them into four categories depending upon\nthe level of health risk. If the WHtR is less than 0.4, it is considered the brown “chili ”category.\nIf the WHtR is between 0.4 and 0.5, it is in the green “pear ”category. If the individual ’s WHtR\nis between 0.5 and 0.6, it is in the yellow “pear-apple ”category. If the individual ’s WHtR is\ngreater than 0.6, he/she is in the red “apple ”category.\nBody shape categorization and 3D body scanning technology\nConnell et al. (2006) developed the Body Shape Assessment Scale (BSAS©), which included\nfemale ’s whole BS from the front view and side view. Female ’s whole BS from the front view is\ncategorized into five shapes based on shoulder (the end of shoulders), waist and the widest\npoints between the waist and crotch, the circle, pear, rectangle, inverted triangle and\nhourglass measured on a 1 –5 scale between two BSs.\nTo evaluate female ’s whole BS from the side view of the body, bust shapes (l or r), front\ntorso shapes (b, B or D) between the bust and below waist, buttocks shapes (Low Hook or\nEven Arch) and back shape (upper back, middle back and lower back) are rated from 1, very\nflat, to 5, very prominent (or full for back shape: Connell et al., 2006 ). In addition, Connell et al.\n(2006) considered posture to be one of the important scales in the BSAS©. They revised\nDouty ’s Posture Scale ( Jones, 1972 ) based on 3D body scan data: Aligned, forward alignment\nand compensating alignment.\nAugust (1981) also described two variations in bust shapes, either flat ( “l”shape) or\nprominent ( “r”shape) and two variations in buttocks shape, “Low Hook ”and “Even Arch. ”\nThe Low Hook shape has a flat line from the waist until it curves under the crotch line, while\nthe Even Arch shape has a symmetrically rounded line from immediately below the waistline\nto the crotch line. In the back shape, August (1981) noted that back curvature from below theOverweight\nand obese\nwomen ’s body\nshape and fit\n\nneck to immediately above the waist depends upon where the curvature is concentrated, in\nthe upper back (from below the neck to the top of the arm), middle back (primary fullness in\nthe curvature up to the mid arm level) and lower back (primary fullness below the underarm).\nAlthough August (1981) andConnell et al. (2006) have defined the body ’s silhouette and\nprofile for the separate parts of the body, the methods used to categorize BSs are difficult to\napply to a traditional pattern-making method because separated body projections depending\non the views can result in several possible BSs ( Song and Ashdown, 2011 ). For example,\nfemales with “r”bust shape can have three different buttocks shapes.\nTo overcome the issues, Song and Ashdown (2011) developed a new and more holistic\nmethod than others to categorize BSs, whic hc o m b i n e df r o n ta n ds i d ev i e wo fb o d yu s i n g\nbody measurements that can directly apply t o the pattern-making process. Using body\nmeasurements extracted from 3D body scann ing technology, they categorized female ’s\nlower BSs among 18 –35-year-old females with a BMI of 34.1 or less. They used principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) to reduce the numbe r of factors that used to categorize BSs by\ncombining similar body measurements into the same factor of a principal component. The\nidentified five factors of principal componen ts were two silhouettes (waist to top hip and\ntop hip to full hip silhouette), two promine nces in the buttocks and abdomen areas and\nthe slope from the abdomen point to front hip point. The researchers found three\nlower BSs among 2,488 young female parti cipants, straight, tilted and curvy ( Song and\nAshdown, 2011 ).\nSong et al. (2021) recently categorized four upper body shapes using 3D body scan data\namong a total of 423 females (ages between 40 and 69) in the United States. The researchers\nfollowed the same procedures of body shape categorization that were used in the previous\nstudy ( Song and Ashdown, 2011 ), which included PCA and cluster analysis. There were eight\nfactors that determined the aged females ’upper body shapes: acromial inclination, upper\nbody slope, neck inclination, waist depth, shoulder angle, overall body length, upper back\ncurvature and back protrusion height ( Song et al., 2021 ).\nDaniell et al. (2014) also used 3D body scans (i.e. the Vitus Smart whole-body scanner by\nHuman Solutions) to examine the relations between body volumes and BMI among female\nand male adults. Particularly for overweigh t and obese female adults, as BMI increased, the\nvolumes of the pelvic (stomach above waist li ne in our study) and abdominal areas (from\nwaist line to crotch in our study) increased at a significantly greater rate than did the whole\nbody volume. For females with a BMI of up t o approximately 32, the body volume in the\nabdominal areas increased significantly an d resulted in a pear-shaped body, while for\nfemales with a BMI of above approximatel y 33, the body volume in the stomach areas\nincreased sharply and resulted in an apple shape ( Daniell et al., 2014 ).\nThere were two studies on the whole BS categorization among South Korean women. Park\nand Park (2013) used 3D body scan data from 1,327 females in South Korea to categorize the\nwhole BS among Korean OWOB women whose aged between 10s and 60s. Through the\nfactor analysis and cluster analysis, there were four BSs: (1) Large torso and below-average\nshoulder width, (2) wide shoulder and below-average lower body, (3) small torso and large\nlower body and (4) small figure. Yu and Kim (2020) recently analyzed 3D anthropometric\ncharacteristics to categorize BSs among middle-aged women aged 40 to 59 ( n5302) with\nnormal weight range (not including overweight and obese) in South Korea.\nAlthough there has been a study on the whole BS categorization among larger women\n(Park and Park, 2013 ) and women with normal weight range ( Yu and Kim, 2020 ) in South\nKorea, their results regarding the whole BSs cannot be generalized for OWOB women in the\nUS To address the knowledge gap, we categorized the whole BSs and examined how\naccurately the current ASTM sizing standards meet the categorized whole BSs for OWOB\nwomen in the US.JFMM\n\nMethods\nThe SizeUSA data are a nationwide anthropometric data in the US ( [TC]2, n.d. ), females with a\nBMI of 25 or higher and aged between 18 and 55 were used in this study. The ages of a total of\n2,672 subjects were categorized into four groups (18 –25 years old: 748, 28%; 26 –35 years old:\n422, 15.8%; 36 –45 years old: 821, 30.7% and 46 –55 years old: 681, 25.5%). Approximately\none-half (1,188, 44.5%) were non-Hispanic Caucasians, followed by non-Hispanic African\nAmericans (679, 25.4%), Mexican Hispanics (241, 9.0%), others (226, 8.5%), non-Mexican\nHispanics (217, 8.1%) and Asians (121, 4.5%). The participants ’BMI ranged from 25.01 to\n69.97. A total of 1401 (52.4%) were overweight (BMI of 25 to <30) and 1,271 (47.6%) were\nobese (BMI of 30 or higher).\nWe followed Park and Park (2013) andSong and Ashdown (2011) ’s study in the whole BS\ncategorization process ( RQ1). In addition to the list of body measurements, the body scan data\nin a.rbd format provided with the SizeUSA data were used to extract additional body\nmeasurements (i.e. width, and front and back points from body ’s side view to calculate\ndepths) using the [TC]2 software. Following the previous studies ( Park and Park, 2013 ;Song\nand Ashdown, 2011 ), a total of 97 body measurements were included initially to select shape-\ndefining measurements, including 58 raw body measurements (i.e. full girth, front/back arc,\nwidth, full depth, length and height) and 39 drop values between the raw body measurements\n(i.e. drop values for girth, front/back arc, width and depth). For example, the depth drop\nvalues were calculated based on the raw measurements and the differences between the side\nseam depth (formula by Song and Ashdown, 2011 ) and front and back depths at the bust,\nwaist, abdomen and hip levels. In addition, the back arc at each body level was obtained by\nsubtracting the front arc from the full girth. Through bivariate correlations, 13 measurements\n(4 raw measurements and 9 drop values) related to BSs were identified regardless of body\nsize, which had significantl y low correlations with each other. After deleting six\nmeasurements that had no significant co rrelations with weight, all of the raw\nmeasurements showed significant, low correlations between each factor and weight that\nranged from /C00.29 to 0.22. To reduce the number of variables and combine similar variables\ninto appropriate dimensions, PCA with varimax rotation ( Hair et al., 1995 ) was used. Any\nitems loadings less than 0.5 and with multiple loadings on two or more variables were\nremoved ( Hair et al., 1995 ). Based on the variables identified from PCA, a hierarchical cluster\nanalysis with the Ward ’s method and K-means cluster analysis were conducted to specify the\npossible number of BSs for the OWOB women. To verify differences from one another in thecategorized BS, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc multiple comparison\ntests were employed to compare the mean value of each cluster that represents the BS. Then,\nthe whole BSs identified for the OWOB women were compared among the different ages,\nethnicities and BMI groups using a cross-tabulation analysis with chi-square test.\nTo define and name each categorized BS, we visually assessed the whole BSs using CLO\nsoftware. Through CLO software, a virtual body model for each BS was created to evaluate\nthe whole BS visually. Further, Adobe Illustrator was used to draw the lines for front and side\nbody silhouettes (black lines shown in Figure 1 ) based upon the width and depth\nmeasurements for the bust, waist, top hip and hip areas. For the front body silhouette, we\nused width measurements for the bust, waist, top hip and hip areas while depth\nmeasurements for the four areas were used to draw the side body silhouette. After\noverlapping the virtual body model and the drawn silhouettes, the whole BSs were defined\nand named, which can support the differences in the identified whole BSs based on the\nstatistical analyses in this study.\nTo identify a perfect fit in the sizing system within each BS group ( RQ2), both ASTM\nsizing standards for plus sizes for curvy and straight (ASTM D6960/D6960M-16)\n(ASTM International, 2016 ) and misses sizes for curvy and straight (ASTM D5585-11)\n(ASTM International, 2012 ) were used for five body parts (bust, under bust, waist, top hip,Overweight\nand obese\nwomen ’s body\nshape and fit\n\nhip). The formula for fit tolerance (measurement plus half of the interval) was used to\ndetermine the size appropriate for each body part ( Simmons et al., 2004 ). The perfect fit was\ndetermined separately for tops and bottoms when three related body measurements (i.e. bust,\nunder bust and waist for tops, waist, top hip and hip for bottoms) were consistent with the\nASTM sizing standards. Thereafter, values of perfect fit for tops (bust, under bust and waist)\nand bottoms (waist, top hip and hip) in each size standard were obtained: For tops and\nbottoms, “0”was recorded when there were no size differences among all three parts, which\nrefers to the perfect fit. Otherwise, if there were size differences in at least one area for tops\nand bottoms, “1”was recorded as fit problems. When a female ’s body did not fall within the\nrange of sizing standard, “2”was coded to indicate “not applicable (NA) ”. Then, for each BS\ngroup, we calculated frequencies and percentages of the values of the perfect fit in each size\nstandard.\nResults\nPrincipal component analysis\nThrough multiple PCA with 13 measurements, three variables that were highly correlated\nwere deleted. A total of eight drop values and two raw measurements (buttocks angle, bust\nfront depth and bust back depth) was found to be useful to categorize the OWOB female\nparticipants ’BSs. As shown in Table 1 , five PCs with eigenvalues greater than 1.0 that\nexplained 76.3% of the variation in the 10 variables were extracted. The PCs were as follows:\nPC1 –Waist to hip silhouette and buttocks prominence; PC2 –Bust prominence; PC3 –Bust to\nwaist back silhouette; PC4 –Back curvature (outward curvature of upper back and inward\ncurvature of lower back) and PC5 –Abdomen prominence.\nAsTable 2 shows, PC1 had high loadings with three drop values, back arc: hip-top hip and\nwidth: hip-waist, and a value of buttocks angle. PC2 was correlated highly with two drop\nvalues, front arc: bust-waist and front depth: bust-waist. PC3 had a high correlation with two\nFigure 1.\nFive whole body\nshapesJFMM\n\nback arc drop values (bust-waist and bust-under bust). PC4 had high loadings with two\nvalues of back length from neck to waist with/wjthout bumps. PC5 had a high loading with a\ndrop value of front depth: abdomen-waist. Analysis of the five variables showed that five PCs\nwith eigenvalues of 1.0 and greater of 10 variables: PC1 523.37%; PC2 516.20%;\nPC3513.24%; PC4 512.48% and PC5 511.02%, explained 76.30% of the variations.\nThe last variable was calculated as a z-score to be used as an independent variable in the\ncluster analysis.\nCluster analysis\nTo determine the optimal number of clusters, a hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted to\ntest the elbow method. The five PCs selected previously were used for this analysis. Ward ’s\nmethods were applied to the five PCs to obtain coefficients of an agglomeration schedule.\nThe coefficients ’gap between 2,668 and 2,669 was much higher than the previous gaps. Thus,\nthe optimal number of clusters was 5, which was obtained by subtracting 2,667 from 2,672.\nA K-mean cluster analysis was performed using the five PC scores to categorize the whole\nBS. After testing two to six clusters, the five-cluster model was chosen (cluster 1: n5502,\n18.8%, cluster 2: n5571, 21.4%, cluster 3 5348, 13.0%, cluster 4: n5593, 22.2%, cluster 5:\nn5658, 24.6). The results for the two-cluster model (cluster 1: n51,345, 49.6%, cluster 2:\nn51,347, 50.4%, iteration stopped at 34), three-cluster model (cluster 1: n51,032, 38.6%,\ncluster 2: n5574, 21.5%, cluster 3: n51,066, 39.9%, iteration stopped at 31), four-cluster\nmodel (cluster 1: n5715, 26.8%, cluster 2: n5427, 16.0%, cluster 3: n5676, 25.3%, cluster 4:\nn5854, 32.0%, iteration stopped at 46), five-cluster model (cluster 1: n5502, 18.8%, cluster\n2:n5571, 21.4%, cluster 3: n5348, 13.0%, cluster 4: n5593, 22.2%, cluster 5: n5658,\n24.6%, iteration stopped at 31) and six-cluster model (cluster 1: n56, 0.2%, cluster 2: n5586,\n21.9%, cluster 3 5501 18.8%, cluster 4: n5364, 13.6%, cluster 5: n5650, 24.3%, cluster 6:\nComponentRotated sums of squared loading\nEigenvalue % Of variance Cumulative %\n1 2.34 23.37 23.37\n2 1.62 16.20 39.57\n3 1.32 13.24 52.81\n4 1.25 12.48 65.285 1.10 11.02 76.30\nNote(s): There are 10 variations in the sample\nVariableComponent\n12345\nBack arc: Hip-Top hip 0.803 0.067 /C00.011 /C00.016 0.237\nButtocks angle 0.799 0.013 /C00.04 0.017 /C00.336\nWidth: Hip-Waist 0.725 0.213 0.129 /C00.166 0.255\nFront arc: Bust-Waist 0.053 0.901 0.041 /C00.026 /C00.094\nFront depth: Bust-Waist 0.153 0.846 /C00.065 /C00.052 0.166\nBack arc: Bust-Waist /C00.033 /C00.02 0.892 /C00.098 0.079\nBack arc: Bust-Under bust 0.075 0.002 0.881 0.034 /C00.051\nBack length with bumps: Neck-waist 0.013 0.064 /C00.008 0.853 /C00.188\nBack length without bumps: Neck-waist /C00.141 /C00.173 /C00.063 0.765 0.276\nFront depth: Abdomen-Waist 0.127 0.052 0.02 0.024 0.889\nNote(s): Values in italics are factor loadings above 0.50Table 1.\nTotal variance\nexplained from pre-PC\nTable 2.\nRotated component\nmatrix of PCA with 10\nvariablesOverweight\nand obese\nwomen ’s body\nshape and fit\n\nn5565, 21.1%, iteration stopped at 33) were calculated. In the six-cluster model, one cluster\n(cluster 1) was represented in less than 1% of the data overall. Therefore, the results verified\nthat the five-cluster model was inappropriate for the whole BS categorization.\nIn the five-cluster model, the results of the one-way ANOVA showed the overall Fwas\nstatistically significant at p< 0.001 for five PC variables that ranged from 241.04 to 518.72\n(Table 3 ). A post hoc analysis showed that there were significant differences at the 0.05 level\nin the means of all of the five variables ’possible pairwise comparisons, with the exception of\nPC4 (Back curvature) between Group 1 and Group 4, which did not differ, and the Z(Abdomen\nprominence) between Group 1 and Group 5, which did not differ. The means and standard\ndeviations of the PCs ’values were ranked a, b, c, d and e according to the magnitude of the\nmean value.\nFor the waist to hip silhouette and buttocks prominence (PC1), Group 1 (G1) had the widest\nhips from the front view and most prominent buttocks from the side view (0.84), followed by\nGroup 5 (G5, 0.26), while Group 4 (G4) had the narrowest hips from the front view and the\nflattest buttocks from the side view ( /C00.66). For bust prominence from the side view (PC2), G5\nhad the most prominent bust (0.75), followed by G2 (0.39), while G2 had the least prominent\nbust from the side view ( /C01.06). With respect to the bust-to-waist back silhouette, G5 was the\nmost sloped and tilted toward the back (0.75) followed by G2 (0.59), while G1 had the\nstraightest and flattest back ( /C00.85). For the back curvature from neck to waist (PC4), G3 had\nthe most outward upper back and most inward lower back (1.69), followed by G5 ( /C00.12),\nwhile G1 ( /C00.33) and G4 ( /C00.38) had the flattest back curvature from neck to waist. With\nrespect to the abdomen prominence ( Z) from the side view, G1 (0.61) and G5 (0.52) had the\nmost prominent abdomen compared to the waist area, followed by G3 (0.05), while G4 had the\nleast prominent abdomen ( /C00.90).\nBody shape categorization ( RQ1)\nTable 4 shows the means and standard deviations of each BS group for the 10 variables.\nAccording to the one-way ANOVA, the overall Fs for all variables ranged from 32.42 to\n2026.21 and differed significantly at p< 0.001. A post hoc analysis was also conducted to\nidentify differences in each variable ’s means among the five BS groups.\nAs shown in Table 4 , with respect to each BS ’s characteristics, G1 had relatively fewer\ndifferences in the front arc and depth, and back arc between the bust and waist levels\ncompared to the other groups. G1 had the least back arc drop between the bust and under\nbust levels among the five groups. This results in a straight front and back upper body\nsilhouette, which can be rectangle-shaped from both the front and side views.

Further, G1 had the most prominent abdomen and buttocks in the lower body\nsilhouette from the side view among the five groups.\nParticipants in G2 had a larger back arc at the bust level compared to that at the under\nbust and waist areas than did the other four groups. Because the bust from the side view does\nnot appear to be more prominent, with a lower value of the front depth drop between the bust\nand waist areas than the waist and abdomen areas, the upper body silhouette overall from the\nside view looks like a parallelogram. For the lower body silhouette from the side view, G2 has\na moderate buttocks and prominent abdomen, which results in a moderately curvy shape.\nG3 has a similar upper body silhouette from the side view to that of G2, with a more\nprominent belly at the waist and abdomen levels than the bust level, while G3 has the curviest\nback (the most prominent upper back and the most inward curvature in the waist level). The\nlower body silhouette from the side view is referred to as the hip tilt shape because the inward\ncurve in the lower back area is above the waist line, and is far from 180 degrees of the waist\nline compared to the floor that causes it to look different from G2.\nG4’s upper body silhouette has an inverted trapezoid shape from the side view, because\nthe front and back depth at the bust level are larger than those at the waist level from the sideVariables for\ncluster analysisBody shape group\nG1 G2 G3 G4 G5 F\nPC1: Buttocks prominence\nBack arc: Hip –\nTop hip1.20a(0.80) 0.34d(0.72) 0.51c(0.72) 0.15e(0.72) 0.89b(0.70) 99.85\nButtocks angle 26.03a(4.70) 21.83c(4.84) 22.97b(4.60) 20.91d(4.68) 23.44b(4.68) 2026.21\nWidth: Hip –\nWaist4.02a(1.12) 2.79b(1.05) 2.80b(1.15) 2.67b(1.05) 3.91a(1.05) 243.90\nPC2: Bust to waist silhouette\nFront arc: Bust –\nWaist4.47c(1.30) 3.40d(1.17) 4.59c(1.32) 5.28b(1.28) 5.83a(1.09) 508.83\nFront depth:\nBust –Waist/C00.25c(1.00) /C01.40e(0.91) /C00.49d(0.99) /C00.10b(0.80) 0.41a(0.73) 265.74\nPC3: Lower back silhouette\nBack arc: Bust –\nWaist0.09c(0.92) 1.61a(0.95) 0.41b(1.12) 0.34b(1.01) 1.41a(0.89) 329.21\nBack arc: Bust –\nUnder bust0.70e(0.86) 1.92b(0.78) 1.37c(0.94) 0.96d(0.86) 2.08a(0.75) 203.16\nPC4: Back curvature\nBack length withbumps: Neck-\nwaist0.25c(0.33) 0.28c(0.30) 1.03a(0.53) 0.27c(0.30) 0.33b(0.30) 42.30\nBack length\nwithout bumps:Neck-waist17.18c(1.04) 17.49b(1.04) 18.92a(1.04) 17.12c(1.02) 17.23c(1.05) 221.30\nZ: Abdomen prominence\nFront depth:Abdomen –\nWaist0.43a(0.34) 0.11c(0.29) 0.22b(0.29) /C00.15d(0.32) 0.40a(0.32) 32.42\nNote(s): Means are ranked a, b, c, d and e ordered by magnitude.

The silhouette lines were drawn based on points of the body\nmeasurements, such as width measures of bust, waist and hip areas from the front view and\nfront X and back X on the bust, waist, hip, abdomen and buttocks from the side view. A total\nof 23 measurements required were extracted from the data to create a 3D virtual model in\nCLO, which included seven height measurements (total, bust, under bust, waist, top hip, hip,\ncrotch), eight girth measurements (neck base, bust, under bust, waist, top hip, hip, thigh,\nupper arm), six length measurements (center front neck to waist, center back neck to waist,\nside neck to apex, apex to apex, total crotch length, across back shoulder) and a drop value\n(shoulder drop) and width value (back shoulder width). After overlapping the black silhouette\nlines with the 3D avatar, we elected to use the avatar to show the five categorized BSs because\nthe avatars for the five BS groups offered a relatively accurate way to visualize each\ngroup ’s BS.\nThe population distribution among the BS groups identified were as follows: G1 ( n5502,\n18.8%); G2 ( n5571, 21.4%); G3 ( n5348, 13.0%); G4 ( n5593, 22.2%) and G5 ( n5658,\n24.6%). The demographic distribution of each BS group was analyzed based on the age\nranges ( Table 6 ). In the 18 –25-year-old and the 26 –35-year-old age range, the majority of the\nsubjects was categorized in G5 (25.5%; 26.1%) and G4 (22.1%; 23.5%), while G3 (14.0%;\n12.1%) had the smallest population.

Less than 19% of women were able to find a perfect fit in all of the three body areas\n(i.e. bust, under bust and waist areas) while 42.6 –60.4% of them had fit problems in at least\none body area for tops in the plus curvy and the misses straight. Similarly, women in G2 and\nG3 would obtain a perfect fit in tops across the three sizing standards: Plus curvy (G2: 15.8%,\nG3: 15.2%), plus straight (G2: 14.2%, G3: 12.9%) and misses straight (G2: 15.9%, G3: 13.5%).\nAbout a half of women in G2 and G3 (47.7 –59.2%) had fit problems at least one area of tops for\nplus curvy, plus straight and misses straight sizing. Interestingly, for women in G5, tops in\nthe misses curvy (15.2%) and straight (11.9%) sizes offered the relatively more perfect fit; and\nfit problems at the same time compared to misses curvy (73.1%) and straight (78.9%) sizes.\nFor bottoms, the plus size curvy sizing system would offer a perfect fit for women in G1\n(10.6%), while for women in G2 (11.9%), G3 (14.1%) and G4 (13.8%), a perfect fit would be\nobtained in the plus straight sizing system. For other sizing systems, less than 8% of women\nin G1-G4 had a perfect fit. Approximately a half of women in G1-G4 (42.8 –58.8%) had fit\nproblems in at least one area of bottoms in the four sizing systems. Finally, women in G5\nwould achieve a perfect fit in bottoms (6.4%) in the misses straight sizing system followed by\nbottoms (4.9%) in the plus curvy sizing system.\nConclusions and implications\nFive whole BSs were categorized among OWOB females in the US: Rectangle-curvy shape;\nparallelogram-moderately curvy shape; parallelogram-hip tilt shape; inverted trapezoid-\nmoderately curvy shape and inverted trapezoid-hip tilt shape. The OWOB females ’BSs were\nidentified primarily based on their side views, as five PCs explained the characteristics of\ntheir body from the side silhouette, although the first PC was related in part to the lower bodyfrom the front view. The results implied that OWOB females ’whole BS differed significantly\nfrom the side views.\nThe whole BS was classified by combining the silhouette for the side upper and lower\nbody. There were three different silhouettes for the side upper body: Rectangle; parallelogram\nand inverted trapezoid. Only one group was identified with the rectangle silhouette, where\nfemales have similarly prominent bust and upper abdomen areas and no curvature in the\nback upper body observed from the side. Females with more prominent upper abdomens\ncompared to their bust areas and curvature in the upper back were classified as having a\nparallelogram shape in their side upper body silhouette. If females had a more prominent bust\nthan their upper abdomen areas, with curvature in their upper back, their side upper body\nsilhouette was categorized into the inverted trapezoid shape. There were two BS groups for\neach parallelogram and inverted trapezoid shape. However, the degree of curvature differed\nin each: For the parallelogram shape, those in G2 showed a more moderate curvature in their\nupper back than did those in G3, while for the inverted trapezoid shape, those in G4 had less\ncurvature in their upper back than did those in G5.\nWith respect to the lower body silhouette, curvy, moderately curvy and hip-tilt shapes\nwere identified among OWOB females.

Interestingly, no straight shape was identified, as their study on BS categorization\nfocused on the general female population. A new lower BS category for the OWOB females\nwas the moderately curvy shape. A moderately curvy and hip-tilt shape tended to relate to the\nside back upper body silhouette: If someone has curvature in her upper back, she is likely to\nhave a hip-tilt shape in her lower body; if she has moderate curvature, her lower body\nsilhouette will have a moderately curvy shape. These results were supported by a previous\nstudy on obesity and posture that found that obesity caused increased thoracic kyphosis and\nhyperlordosis ( Fabris De Souza et al. , 2005 ). This difference may be because this study\nfocused specifically on BMI groups of OWOB females.\nThis study is the first attempt to analyze perfect fit and fit problems for tops and bottoms\nby comparing the ASTM sizing charts with body measurements in newly identified BS\ngroups. For G1, tops in straight missy size and in plus size for curvy, and bottoms in plus size\nfor curvy were better than other sizing categories; for G2, tops in plus size for curvy, tops in\nmisses and plus size for straight and bottoms in plus size for straight fit better than in other\nsizing systems; for G3 and G4, tops in plus size for curvy and in misses size for straight, and\nbottoms in plus size for straight fit better than in other sizing systems; for G5, tops in misses\nsize for curvy and straight fit better than in other sizing systems. This sizing system provided\nthe greatest number of perfect fits for bottoms in misses size for straight and fit problems.\nAccording to the results, less than four-fifths or more of OWOB female adults in the US would\nfind it difficult to obtain a perfect fit for both tops and bottoms in the current ASTM sizing\nsystems for both misses and plus sizes. This study has implications for apparel product\ndevelopers and designers in the US, in that the sizing system for OWOB female adults needs\nto be revised according to the whole BS categories.\nIdentifying whole BSs among OWOB women in the US contributes significantly because\nit will help apparel companies that target the markets of larger women develop a new sizing\nsystem. Understanding larger women ’s BSs and related anthropometric characteristics will\nprovide insights into the way the current ASTM sizing system needs to be updated. For\nexample, OWOB women are likely to have fit problems in tops because of their looser fit in the\nbust areas if they choose tops based on their waist sizes. Further, they are likely to have fit\nproblems in bottoms (i.e. looser fit in their hip areas) if they choose sizes based on their waist\nsize. These results implied that apparel companies that target larger women in the US should\nconsider modifying the waist sizes when they draft patterns that are larger than the current\nstandardized sizing system. Improving the sizing system for larger female consumers willBody shape group\nχ2G1 G2 G3 G4 G5\nNA 143a190ab135b224b61c\n28.5% 33.3% 38.8% 37.8% 9.3%\nBottoms in misses size: Straight\nPerfect fit 37a10b18ac17bc42a228.18\n7.4% 1.8% 5.2% 2.9% 6.4%\nFit problems 251a336b174a341b542c\n50.0% 58.8% 50.0% 57.5% 82.4%\nNA 214a225a156a235a74b\n42.6% 37.4% 44.8% 39.6% 11.2%\nNote(s): Frequencies are ranked a, b, c, d and e ordered by magnitude.

In addition, if OWOB female consumers are better\nserved, they will become loyal to a certain apparel brand that provides better fit and size,\nwhich in turn increases the company ’s revenues.\nFurthermore, this study contributes to body-related literature by filling gaps in missing\nwhole BS categories among OWOB females. This study has a methodological implication as\nwell, in that the PCA and cluster analysis Song and Ashdown (2011) andPark and Park (2013)\nsuggested were useful methods to categorize the whole BS from the front and side views\nsimultaneously.\nLimitations and future studies\nThis study used the SizeUSA data to categorize BSs in the OWOB female population in the\nUS Future studies to confirm the BSs suggested and compare them using different datasets\ncollected by different companies (e.g. SizeNA) may be conducted. Further research can also be\nconducted using the same methods to categorize BSs for OWOB men in the US. Lastly,\nalthough we included body measurements for both upper and lower bodies, but thigh girth\nwas excluded due to the high correlation with other body measurements. In future studies,\ncategorizing lower BSs among OWOB women may include thigh girth so that it can provide\npractical insights to improve the sizing system for bottoms.\nReferences\nAshley, B.
