Body Measurements  
(Ask a friend for help or have your lo cal tailor measure you based on our guide.  Please note that our tailor will 
need to add allowances to your body measurements depending on your body profile. ) 
 1. NECK  
Measure around the lower part of your neck, 
placing a finger between the tape measure and 
the neck. You should not feel restricted by the 
tape for a comfortable fit, and should be able to 
put your index finger inside the tape.  
 2. CHEST  
Measure around the fullest part of the chest. 
The measuring tape is usually around the 
nipple level, under the armpits, and over your 
shoulder blades . Do not overinflate your chest 
but stand normally;  you should be able to fit 
your index finger in between the tape and your 
chest.  

 3. STOMACH  
Measure around the widest part of your 
abdomen, placing a finger between yo ur body 
and the tape. Make sure the tape is at the 
same height at all times. The widest part of the 
abdomen usually coincides with the belly 
button. Do not hold your stomach in.  
 4. WAIST  
Wearing trousers and a shirt put the measuring 
tape around your waist  at the height were you 
would wear your pants and adjust to your 
designed snugness with room for a finger. 
Make sure the tape is snug and does not ride 
over the waistband but you should be able to 
put your index finger inside the tape.  
 
As a guide, this m easurement will be about 2 
inches above what you take off -the-rack as 
they like to flatter, but unfortunately we need 
real measurements.  
 5. HIPS  
Wearing trousers, measure around the fullest 
part of your hips, placing a finger between your 
body and the tape . Make sure the tape is 
straight at all times.  
Make sure your pockets are empty and the 
tape is not restrictive. As a guide, you should 
not make the tape too snug. You only just be 
able to feel the tape when measuring.  

 6. SHOULDER  
Measure across the top of  the shoulder from 
one edge to the other. Ensure you take the 
curved contour over the top of the shoulders as 
shown.  
Wearing your best fitted shirt or suit measure 
up to the shoulder seams.  
 7. JACKET LENGTH  
Measure from the highest part of your shoulder 
(where shoulder and neck seams meet) all the 
way down to the desired length, usually around 
the thumb joint. When measuring, adopt an 
upright position with both arms on your sides.  
A shorter, trendier length, looks good when 
coupled with jeans, but is an ac quired taste in 
a suit.  
 8. SLEEVE LENGTH  
Wearing a shirt that you like, measure with arm 
at your side, from the shoulder's seam all 
along the arm until you find the desired length. 
Your measurement will be the length of your 
jacket sleeve.  
We recommend th at the sleeve should go to 
the base of your thumb (located at the wrist 
joint ). 

 9. BICEP  
Measure around your upper arm at the widest 
point when flexed leaving one finger of space 
to take the measure.  
 10.  WRIST  
Measure around your wrist bone leaving one 
finger of space to take the measure.  
 11.  CROTCH  
Measure from the top middle of the back pants 
waist (see point A) all along the crotch seam 
through your legs until the top of front waist 
(see point B)  
 
Important: If you have any doubt, compare this 
measure w ith pants that fit you well.  

 12.  THIGH WIDTH  
Wearing trousers, empty your pockets then, 
Start at the top of your inseam, measure 
around your thigh with room for a finger.  
 
 13.  PANTS LENGTH

the side pant seam un til the bottom of your 
pants or roughly 1 inch from the ground.  
 14.  INSEAM  
Measure from the lowest part of your crotch 
area to the floor.  
Make sure the tape is tight along the inside of 
your leg, that you are standing straight, and 
then measure.
