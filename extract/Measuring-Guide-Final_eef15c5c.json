Usually about 10 – 20 minutes is enough.  \n \nb) It would help if..  \n- You had assistance from a friend when measuring  \n- You wore a good fitting dress -shirt and slacks. If you do not have these items, fine, just  \n  wear anything that fits your form (t -shirt and boxers included). Do not wear jeans as the y    \n  seriously alter measurements, and also make sure to empty your pockets!  \nc) When measuring..  \n       - Hold the measuring tape flat against the body. It should beheld snug enough so not to  \n         droop, but never so tight as to feel restrictive.  \n       - Take your measurements to the nearest quarter (.25) inch.  \n       - Do not add wiggle room to your measurements. We will adjust the fit based off of your  \n         selected preferences and build. All measurements are “skin measurements”.  \nd) All that is left to do is to..  \n      - Read the instructions per measurement, understand what it is asking of you and follow.  \n      - Look to the photos as guidance.  \n      - Write down your measurements on the last page and forward it to us on  [ contact@bebetailor.com  ]. \n      - If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n1. Neck          \n \n● Measure around your neck at the height where your  \n    collar, if buttoned, would be.  \n \n● This measurement should be taken along the lower  \n    section of the neck, below your Adam’s apple and above  \n    your sternal notch.  \n \n● The tape should be comfortably touching the skin, with  \n    enough room so that you do not feel restricted.  \n \n● My neck is _._ centimeters.  \n \n      When we take this measurement, based off your height/weight/fit preference, we add a percentage to ensure your  \n      shirt collar fits comfortably after multiple washings during which it will shrink slightly.  \n \n \n2. Full chest  \n \n● Measure around the chest and body at its fullest part  \n   (typically right under the armpits and shoulder  \n   blades, right across the nipples).  \n \n● Hold the tape against the body tight enough so that  \n    it does not slip down, but not so tight that it re stricts  \n    breathing. It should be “snug”.  \n \n \n● Make sure the tape is horizontal and the person's  \n    arms are by their side; then take a normal breath and  \n    measure.  \n \n● Do not puff out your chest.  \n \n● Double check this measurement.  \n \n● My full chest  is _._ centimeters.  \n \n \n      This measurement should be at the point your chest is its largest – which should be where we have  \n      specified. If you have an extremely large or muscular chest, remember that you will not be flexing in this  \n      suit, so take the measurement in a relaxed, normal state.  \n\n \n3. Full shoulder width  \n \n● Measure from the end of the right shoulder  \n    to the end of the left shoulder.  \n \n \n● We define the “end of the shoulder” as  \n     where the horizontal plane of the shoulder  \n     intersects the vertical plane of the arm (see  \n     illustration).  \n \n● Double check the measurement.  \n \n● My full shoulder width is _._ centimeters.  \n \n \n     This is the measurement we see taken wrong most often, so be very careful. To check this me asurement,  \n     take your best fitting jacket and measure your shoulders while wearing it. Now look at both - your jacket  \n     measurement should be the same to a ½ inch larger. If it’s not, ask yourself: is your current jacket too large  \n     or too sma ll? From this you can now more accurately determine your shoulder size. If you need help, please  \n     ask us for further clarification!  \n \n \n \n4. Right &  left sleeves  \n \n       ● Measure from the end of the right shoulder to the “pinch”  \n           of the hand.  \n       ● The “pinch” of the hand is found where the base of the thumb  \n           and the base of the index finger intersect (approximately  \n           2.5 centimeters above the index finger knuckle).  \n       ● My right sleeve is _._ centimeters.  \n       ● Repeat the same process for the left hand.  \n       ● My left sleeve is _._ centimeters.  \n \n        Place a safe ty pin where you determined the shoulder points to be  \n        as this will come useful later for other measurements.  \n \n \n\n \n5. Biceps  \n \n● Keep you r arms by your side and measure around  \n     the fullest part of the bicep.  \n \n● You need only measure one side.  \n \n● My biceps are _._ centimeters.  \n \n \n       No need to flex, unless you are a body builder – but  \n       we’ll  be able to see that from your other  \n       measurements and will make sure you have plenty of  \n       room in the arm.  \n \n \n6. Wrist s \n  \n● Measure around the fullest part of the wrist.  \n \n● You need only measure one side.  \n \n● My wrist s are _._ centimeters.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7. Waist/stomach  \n \n● Measure around the fullest part of the waist/stomach  \n    or right below your bottom ribs, whichever is greater.  \n \n       ● My jacket waist is _._ centimeters.  \n \n       If you are a large man, make sure to measure around the  \n       widest point her e. Also, be prepared for us to contact you  \n       to collect a few additional measurements to ensure we  \n       build your clothing correctly.  \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n8. Hips/seat  \n \n● Measure around the fullest part of your hips and buttocks.  \n \n       ● My hips/seat  is _._ centimeters.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9. Front jacket length  \n \n       ● Keep your arms straight at your side, and measure  \n           straight down the front from the base of the neck  \n           (on either side) to the point of your thumb knuckle.  \n \n● My front jacket length is _._ centimeters.  \n \n      This measurement helps us determine your jacket length,  \n      but is not the only factor we consider. We also look at your  \n      height, full back length, the length of jacket you are used to,  \n      and the type of jacket we are building for you.  \n \n \n \n\n \n    10. Front chest width  \n \n    ● With the person's arms by their side, measure across  \n          the front of the chest.  \n \n    ● Start at the front of the right armpit, continue measuring  \n         across the nipples, and then stop at the front of the left  \n         armpit. Do not measure under the arms.  \n \n     ● This is the front part of the full chest measurement we  \n         took in step 2.  \n \n     ● My front chest width  is _._ centimeters.  \n \n     This is not half the chest measurement  – it’s from the point  \n     where your armpit starts – straight across the chest – to the  \n     exact spot on the other side. You can take this measurement  \n     facing the person (unlike the picture).  \n \n \n \n \n   11. Back width  \n \n     ● With the person's arms by their side, measure across  \n          the back.  \n \n     ● Start at the back of the right armpit, continue measuring     \n         across the shoulder blade s, and then stop at the back of  \n         the left ar mpit. Do not measure under the arms.  \n \n     ● This is the back part of the full chest measurement we  \n         took in step 2.  \n \n     ● My back width is _._ centimeters.  \n \n     Again , this is not half the chest measurement – it’s from  \n     the point where your armpit starts – straight across the  \n     back of the chest – to the exact spot on the other side.  \n \n \n \n\n   12. Half shoulder width (right & left)   \n \n     ● Measure from the end of the right shoulder to the base of  \n         the right side of the neck.  \n \n     ● We define the “side of the neck” as the point at which the  \n         vertical plane of the neck intersects the horizontal plane of  \n         the shoulder.  \n \n     ● My half shoulder width (right) is _._ centimeters.  \n \n     ● Repeat the same process for the left side.  \n \n     ● My half shoulder width (left) is _._ centimeters.  \n \n     Keep the safety pin attached from measurements 4 & 5 at  \n     the shoulder points, this will ensure it aligns perfectly with  \n     the other measurements.  \n \n \n \n \n   13. Full back length   \n \n     ● Measure from the base of the back of the neck to the floor.  \n \n     ● We define the “base of the back of the neck” as the point at  \n         which the 7th cervical bone is located. To easily find this point,  \n         have the person being measured tilt his head forward so that  \n         the “knobby” bone at the base of the neck becomes obvious.  \n         Once located, you can have the person stand straight  again and  \n         then measure.  \n \n     ● No shoes please!  \n      \n     ● Double check this measurement.  \n \n     ● My full back length  is _._ centimeters.  \n \n     This measurement helps us determine your jacket length, but is not  \n     the only factor we consider. We also look at your height, jacket  \n     length measurement, the length of your current coat, and the type  \n     of jacket we are building for you.  \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n   14. Half back length   \n \n     ● Measure from the base of the back of the neck to the top of the  \n         pants waistband area.  \n \n     ● My half back length is _._ centimeters.  \n \n     No jeans here – they would give us a measurement that is too long!  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   15. Trouser waist   \n \n     ● Measure around your waist at the level where you would  \n         normally wear your pant’s belt.  \n \n     ● With the tape measure snug around your waist, relax, and take  \n         the measurement.  \n \n     ● Don't be alarmed if this measurement seems larger than expected;  \n         off-the-rack pants are normally labeled as being smaller than what  \n         they really are.  \n \n     ● My trouser waist is _._ centimeters.  \n \n     It’s the truth – your 36 in ch waist jeans are more like 39 inches.  \n     Why they do this, we do not know!  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n   16. Trouser’s outseam   \n \n     ● Measure from the top of your pant’s waistband to the floor  \n         along the outside of your leg.  \n \n     ● Make sure the tape is tight, that you are standing straight, and  \n         then measure. No shoes please!  \n \n     ● Double check this measurement.  \n \n     ● My trouser’s outseam is _._ centimeters.  \n \n     We will build your trousers to this exact measu rement. If you are  \n     interested in higher fitting trousers such as those made for  \n     braces/suspenders, or like to have a shorter or longer leg fit,  \n     please let us know in the notes section.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   17. Trouser’s inseam   \n \n   ● Measure from  the lowest part of your crotch area to the floor.   \n \n   ● Make sure the tape is tight along the inside of your leg, that you  \n        are standing straight, and then measure. No shoes please!   \n \n     ● My trouser’s inseam  is _._ centimeters.  \n \n     How  high should you measure? Only as high as you’re comfortable with.  \n     Don’t worry, this measurement is only a small part of three measurements  \n     we use to determine this final length.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n   \n   18. Crotch   \n \n     ● Measure from the front top of the pant's waistband to the back top of the pant's waistband.  \n \n     ● Make sure not to take this measurement too tight.  \n \n     ● My crotch measurement  is _._ centimeters.  \n \n     The key here is to wear a comfortable pair of slacks – no jeans!  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n   19. Thigh   \n \n   ● Measure around your thigh at its widest point.  \n \n     ● You need measure only one side.  \n \n     ● My thighs are _._ centimeters.  \n \n     We are looking for the widest section of your thigh here – this     \n     may be lower or higher than pictured.  \n \n \n \n \n\n    \n \n \n   20. Knee   \n \n     ● Measure around your knee at its widest point.  \n \n     ● You need only measure one side.  \n \n     ● My knees are _._ centimeters.  \n \n     The key here is to wear a comfortable pair of slacks – no jeans!  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n   21. Right full sleeve   \n  \n     ● Measure from the base of the right side of the neck to the  \n         pinch of the right hand.  \n \n     ● This is a “check” measurement. This measurement should  \n         be within a half -inch of measurements 4 and 13 combined.  \n         If not, recheck those two measurements.  \n \n     ● My right full sleeve  is _._ centimeters.  \n \n \n   22. Left full sleeve   \n \n     ● Measure from the base of the right side of the neck to the  \n         pinch of the left hand.  \n \n     ● This is a “check” measurement. This measurement should  \n         be within a half -inch of measurements 5 and 14 combined.  \n         If not, recheck those two measurements.  \n \n     ● My left full sleeve  is _._ centimeters.  \n \nAnd that’s it!
