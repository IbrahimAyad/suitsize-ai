Hodges Human Nutrition and Foods  \n\n(ABSTRACT)  \n\nThe purpose of this research was to examine five methods of determining frame size. In addition, self perception of frame size and of desired weight was compared to two height-weight table recommendations. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to determine relationships between measurements used as criteria for frame measures and between the five frame measures studied. Agreement of frame size identification was examined by comparing percentages of small, medium and large frame for each method. While the Pearson correlation coefficient of wrist circumference with elbow breadth was greater than 0.5 for both men and women, the correlations between frame measures using wrist circumference criteria and frame measures using elbow breadth criteria were less than 0.5. Self-perceived frame size was not significantly correlated with any of the five frame measures examined or with weight perception variables. Comparison of weight perception with evaluation of measured weight using two height-weight tables indicated men appear to desire to be heavier and women appear to desire to be thinner than weights recommended for height and measured frame size. Results were discussed in relation to findings of other researchers. Recommendations were made concerning the frame measures examined, the relationship of frame size perception to self-evaluation of weight, and the use of height-weight tables in determining weight goals.  \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  \n\nThe Lord has blessed the writing of this thesis in many ways, beginning with bringing me back to graduate school.  \n\nI would especially like to thank Dr. Pat Hodges for her friendship and positive support.

Describing the body in terms of volume, mass, length and surface area indicates physical magnitude or body size. The amounts of body constituents of fat, muscle, water and ash are the components of body composition while the third aspect of physique - body structure - includes the skeleton and muscle-fat distribution or arrangement of body parts. The difficulty in accurately measuring body size, composition, and structure is compounded by the interrelation among each component. Many measures of physique are a combination of two or three aspects and are applied for different purposes by researchers and practitioners in dietetics and nutrition, anatomy, biomechanics, physiology of exercise, human genetics, general medicine and anthropology (2).  \n\nFor dietitians, nutritionists, and health educators measures of body physique are valuable in assessing nutritional status and in assisting clients to determine an appropriate body weight. Anthropometric indexes, such as weight-height relationships, skinfold measurements and determinations of percent body fat are important components of these processes (3).  \n\nOne guide which is frequently used by dietitians in determining appropriate body weight is a height-weight standard or height-weight table (4-7). Numerous tables are available, with the most widely used being those from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (5,6).  \n\nThe concept of frame size was introduced as a factor in appropriate weight with the presentation of revised height-weight tables in 1942 and 1943 by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (8). However, guidelines for determining frame size were not presented other than to suggest that chest girth, hip width and length of trunk were body points to consider (9). In the years since the concept was presented several methods developed for determining frame size have been attributed to the general public (10). Anthropometric measurement studies have also been reported with samples of various sizes. Measurements taken during two National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) have provided the largest sample and have been utilized to develop a determination of frame size from elbow breadth measurements (11). While there is conceptual validity in frame size, the lack of available objective measures based on research of a large sample has  \n\ncontributed to confounding the subjective judgments of frame size (12).  \n\nFive Frame Measures Selected  \n\nOne popular method for determining frame size, the development of which has been credited to the lay public, is to measure, in inches, the circumference of one's wrist (6,1o). Separate sets of values are given for men and women to determine small, medium and large frame. A second method using wrist circumference, specifies that the right wrist be measured in centimeters (13). The wrist measurement is then divided into the person's height in centimeters, measured without shoes. The resulting height:wrist circumference ratio provides an \"r\" value, with separate sets of values for men and women to determine small, medium and large frame.  \n\nThe NHANES data on frame size determinations from elbow breadth measurements has been utilized to develop a Frameter, an instrument for measuring elbow breadth  \n\n(14,15). The Frameter instrument, marked for both males and females, provides a rapid assessment of small, medium and large frame based on elbow breadth in centimeters. Additionally, the elbow breadth measurement and height can be used in a computation to give a more accurate assessment of small, medium and large frame with sets of values defined for men and women (16). The fifth method of determining frame size was developed by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company for height-weight tables released in 1983 (17). This frame measure uses NHANES data on elbow breadth measures to categorize frame size into small, medium and large frame separately for men and women by height ranges.  \n\nStatement of Problem  \n\nWithout objective guidelines for determining frame size, perception of one's frame size may be unrealistic and misleading. Given the range of suggested weight for a particular height using the 1983 Metropolitan Life Insurance Company height-weight tables, it is possible for a person to overestimate or underestimate a calculation of suggested weight by as much as ten to twenty pounds. Misjudging frame size can contribute to unrealistic goals of appropriate weight. There are a variety of methods available for determining frame size, some without population measurements to substantiate them. For the professional in the field assisting clients in setting realistic goals for weight, this variety of methods available for measuring frame size can be confusing. This confusion is compounded for the lay public.  \n\nPurpose of Research  \n\nThe purpose of this research was to examine and evaluate five methods of determining frame size which can be found in textbooks and references used by dietitians and nutritionists. The methods chosen were compared for agreement of frame size identification in order to provide recommendations for health care practitioners. Additionally, self perception of frame size and of desired weight was compared to height-weight table recommendations to explore the relationship between perception of weight and recommendations used in health care.  \n\nResearch Questions  \n\n\\ Are measurements of elbow breadth, wrist circumference, shoe length and shoe width indicative of\n\nconcepts of desirable weight and height-weight tables (21,22).F However, conceptual and methodological objections to the use of height-weight tables as a means of evaluating the desirability of a given weight for a given person have been raised. These objections include technical quality of the data, relationship of weight to obesity and selection of relative weight indices, sampling and design problems and confounding variables.  \n\nFor the Metropolitan tables, 10% of the heights and weights from the data base of the 1979 Build Study were self-reported, rather than measured. Of those measured, all wore non-standard clothing and shoes. It can be noted that in a study of self-reported heights and weights, Schlichting et.al. found a tendency for tall and heavy people to underestimate their measurements while short and thin people overestimate their measurements (23). I However, Pirie et.al. found women's self-reported weight tended to be low and that reporting of height seemed to be accurate with a slight tendency for women to report shorter heights and men taller heights (24).  \n\nAlthough a relationship exists between weight and adiposity, the correlation is not strong (21). Adiposity or fatness is not as easy to measure, however it is important to distinguish between overweight and overfatness. A relationship which does appear to be a  \n\nvalid and practical indicator of overfatness is the Body Mass Index (BMI), weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (25). Skinfold Thickness, a direct measure of body fat correlates highly with BMI while height has a near zero correlation. A range of 20 to 25 weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared is now frequently recommended as the standard of normality for body weight (25). The midpoint of the medium frame recommendations of the Metropolitan tables yields a BMI of 22.5 weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. Several studies have indicated that higher Body Mass Indexes are associated with lower mortality for older age groups, suggesting age should be a factor in height-weight tables.  \n\nThe sampling problem in the data base of the 1979 Build Study used for the Metropolitan tables is one of representation (21). Primarily white men from the upper and middle income levels under the age of 60 years were represented. Therefore, standards reflected in the tables may not be appropriate for all Americans and generalized use with various groups of people, especially older people, is not recommended. In the analysis of the 1979 Build Study data, a design problem becomes apparent in that insurance policies were the unit of analysis rather than people. People with more than one policy were counted more than once, as were people with breaks in policy coverage (21,22). This is important when weight is linked to mortality from this data since it was the termination of a policy which was counted. The relationship between termination of policy (cause of death) and weight was not examined.  \n\nThere are several confounding variables in determining the relationship between weight and mortality to develop desirable height-weight recommendations. A major variable is that of the effect of cigarette smoking on weight, health and mortality (21). The 1979 Build Study did not consider this variable in the compilation of data.  The variation in skeletal mass is a variable which appears to have been addressed by the small, medium and large frame weight ranges within the Metropolitan tables. However, the suggested method for determining frame size presented with the 1983 tables was not used to measure the people from which the weight data is derived. The weight of the skeleton is also affected by variations in bone density: variations which have been correlated to age, sex and race.  \n\nIn summary, height-weight tables have been developed primarily by insurance companies based on weight associated with lowest mortality. The data bases used have not been representative of the total population nor is the relationship between excess weight and mortality clear from the analysis. The use of frame size as a component in height-weight tables was introduced without appropriate measurement and may not be of value in determining overfatness.  \n\nFrame Measures  \n\nFrame size is a skeletal concept reflecting differences of chest breadth, hip width, bone thickness and length of trunk relative to total height when comparing persons of the same height and sex (26). Factor analyses have shown frame size to have conceptual validity, however, objective measures are needed. Ideally, measures of skeletal length, width and depth would be statistically independent of each other and unaffected by subcutaneous fat deposits at measurement sites (12).  \n\nSeveral methods of determining frame size can be found which do not appear to have been substantiated by a measured population. Hui gives credit to the general public for the development of two of these methods (6,10). The first method is to encircle the wristbone with the index finger and thumb. A large frame is indicated if the fingers do not touch or overlap, a medium frame is indicated if the fingers just touch and if they overlap a small frame is indicated. The second method provides actual wrist measurements in inches for men and women which indicate frame size. While the first method perhaps considers height in relation to finger length and is at least an individual assessment, the second method makes no distinction between heights. A third method utilizes a grid of height measured in feet and inches on the vertical and wrist measured in inches on the horizontal. Shadings for small, medium and large frame within the grid clarify the intercepts (27). While this method distinguishes between height it does not distinguish between men and women.  \n\nGrant measured 100 male and 100 female adult patients at Duke University Medical Center to develop a more reliable method for determination of frame size (13). Measurements of height without shoes and the right wrist circumference distal to the styloid process, in centimeters, were utilized. By dividing wrist circumference into height, body frame size was related to the height: wrist circumference ratio \"r\" calculated. Arbitrarily the population was proportioned into $\\mathtt{258}$ Small frame, $^{508}$ medium frame and $\\tt{258}$ large frame. Ranges of \"r\" values for men and for women indicate small, medium and large frame.  \n\nA frame size model has been developed by Katch and Freedson based on conceptualization of frame size as a two dimensional scheme simultaneously considering body stature\n\nframe size?  \n\n\\Are there significant correlations between the selected five methods of determining frame size?  \n\n\\ Are there differences between the five frame measure methods evaluated in terms of the distribution of small, medium and large frames?  \n\n\\ Are there significant correlations between self perceived frame size and the five methods of determining frame size?  \n\n\\ Is self perception of frame size significantly correlated with perception of mother's and/or father's frame size?  \n\n\\ Are there differences between men and women in their perceptions of weight and desired weight?  \n\n\\ Is there a significant correlation between perception of frame size, perception of weight and height-weight tables?  \n\nDefinitions  \n\nFor the purposes of this study the following definitions apply:  \n\nFrame size : Length, width and depth of skeleton (12).  \n\nReported Height/Weight : Measurement reported by subject when asked \"what is your height?, What is your weight?\".  \n\nPerceived Frame Size : Frame size reported by subject following, \"People are often described as small, medium or large frame to indicate their bone thickness or body size. How would you describe yourself?\".  \n\nMeasured Height/weight : Subject's height and weight measured using a platform scale apparatus.  \n\nLimitations  \n\nThe sample population of subjects was drawn from students enrolled in two popular elective courses at a southeastern university. Reflecting the total university population, a small number of nonwhites (10.3%) were measured within the sample. Therefore, data were analyzed only from the majority Caucasian subsample. Although the age range of measured subjects was 18 to 42 years, the majority (96.7%) were 18 to 24 years old.  \n\nChapter 2  \n\nREVIEW OF LITERATURE  \n\nReview of Literature  \n\nThere are several areas of study to consider in exploring the concept of body frame measures. The concept of frame size is strongly linked to height-weight tables; especially the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tables. Reported studies of attempts to measure frame size are limited and, in some cases, the number of subjects is sma1l. Another concern in determining frame size measures is the potential for prediction of body fat, lean body weight and relative weight. Finally, perceptions of body frame size and weight in terms of individual body image are a part of the exploration of body frame size measures.  \n\nHeight-Weight Tables  \n\nThe development of height-weight tables has been accomplished primarily by insurance companies. The first tables were indications of average weights for insurees and usually included age. It was assumed that weight would increase with age and judgements concerning desirable weights were not made. Generally, it was believed that underweight people were of greater insurance risk because they lacked reserves to draw upon during disease. However, in 1908, the chief medical director of the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York presented an analysis of his company's data from which he concluded overweight was more of a risk factor than underweight except for those people under the age of twenty-five (8).  \n\nAs pneumonia and tuberculosis were brought under control, the popularly held belief that overweight children and young adults had a higher chance of surviving severe illness was questioned. It was recognized that overweight in the early years was predisposing to obesity in older adults. The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company challenged the use of average weights as standards and developed tables based on weights associated with longevity. These tables, for women and men, presented in 1942 and 1943, defined average weight of ages 25-30 as \"ideal\" since these weights were associated with longevity. These tables also introduced the concept of small, medium and large body frame as a factor in appropriate weight although no guidelines were given for determining frame size (9,18).  \n\nThe Metropolitan Life Insurance Company revised its tables in 1959 based on a Build and Blood Pressure Study conducted by the Society of Actuaries. It was concluded that the lowest mortality rates were associated with below average weight and from these data, tables of \"desirable\" weight for women and men age 25 and over were developed  \n\n(19). Again weight ranges for small, medium and large frame were presented without providing a method of determination. Later it was said the categories were created by dividing the weight distribution for each height into thirds and labeling each third accordingly (20).  \n\nIn 1983 the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company presented another revision of its height-weight tables utilizing updated information from the 1979 Build Study by the Society of Actuaries. This study indicated that the difference between average weight and the lower weights associated with lowest mortality had narrowed. F However, the increased weights of the new height-weight tables still fell below average weights. The 1983 Metropolitan Life Insurance Company height-weight (Metropolitan) tables utilized anthropometric measures from the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES 1971-75) to provide guidelines for determining frame size. Elbow breadth measurements from the NHANES data were grouped such that $^{508}$ ofthe population measured fell within the medium frame category and $\\mathbf{258}$ of the population each fell within the small and large frame categories (17).  \n\nHeight-Weight Table Considerations  \n\nSeveral analyses of data have been used to correlate weight with mortality experience in the development of the\n\nand width (28). Body width measurements which were marginally related to stature, based on correlation analyses, were chosen to develop a scheme which considers frame size in two related but independent dimensions. The sum of biacromial and bitrochanter diameter measurements in centimeters was chosen to represent body width, with height in centimeters as the linear body measurement. A linear regression equation, the \"HAT\" frame size formulation, was developed to determine the least squares line of best fit between height and the sum of the two width measurements. The boundaries of small, medium and large frames were determined by drawing lines perpendicular to the regression line at minus one standard deviation and plus one standard deviation from the mean stature. Separate models for men and women were developed based on different calculated slopes of the regression line.  \n\nElbow breadth measurements from the data sets of the first Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HANES I) were used by Frisancho and Flegel to develop frame size categories (11). Zero order correlation coefficients of weight, elbow breadth and bitrochanteric breadth to the log transformed sum of skinfold values were calculated from the 16,494 measured individuals, aged 18 to 74, for age, sex and race. Elbow breadth, in both men and women and in both blacks and whites, exhibited the lowest correlation to  \n\nskinfold thickness. Some correlation was noted between elbow breadth and the 25-54 year old age category. Sex, age and race specific categories of small, medium and large frame were determined using elbow breadth measures below the 15th percentile, between the 15th and 85th percentiles and above the 85th percentiles respectively.  \n\nFrisancho has continued to study elbow breadth as a determinant of frame size by combining data from HANES I and HANES II (14,15). The total sample of children and adults, ages 1 to 74 years, was 44,130. He has developed several frame indexes from the data available. Frame Index One was determined using age and sex specific percentiles of elbow breadth. From these percentiles, a small frame category was established with age and sex specific percentiles of elbow breadth below the 15th, a medium frame category of those between the 15th and 85th, and a large frame category of those above the 85th percentile. Frame Index Two incorporates height by dividing the square root of height, measured in centimeters, into elbow breadth, in millimeters and multiplying by ten. Again the three frame categories were established using below the 15th, between the 15th and 85th and above the 85th sex- and age-specific percentiles. These two Frame Indexes were modified for the Frameter, an instrument developed by Frisancho to measure elbow breadth. The Frameter provides a quick assessment of frame size using average values which do not consider age or height (29). A formula on the Frameter allows for consideration of height, but again the frame categories do not consider age (16).  \n\nThe bony chest breadth has been studied by Garn as a frame size standard in nutritional assessment (30). Radiogrammetric data from participants in the Western Scotland Health Survey were used to correlate bony chest breadth with weight, height and three measures of fatness. The bony chest breadth diameter as measured on 70 millimeter photographic films was compared with weight data on each subject Partial correlations were calculated with the bony chest breadth measure held constant to show the effect of height on weight, and with height held constant to show the effect of the bony chest breadth measure on weight. Height was also correlated to weight. The relationship between bony chest breadth and weight was stronger than the relationship between height and weight. The partial correlations between bony chest breadth and weight corrected for height were also higher than those between height and weight corrected for bony chest breadth. After establishing an appropriate weight correction factor for bony chest breadth, three frame size groupings were established.  \n\nStudies Using Frame Measures  \n\nA comparison of Grant's method of determining frame size and the guidelines for determining frame size from the 1983 Metropolitan tables which utilize elbow breadth data frame NHANES I was made by Nowak and Schulz (31). Thirty-eight men and forty women were measured for height, weight and elbow breadth. The two methods produced the same frame measure for $648$ of the men and $^{748}$ of the women. Grant's method determined 53% of the men and 69% of the women as small frame, 47% of the men and 29% of the women as medium frame, and none of the men and $^{28}$ of the women as large frame.  Determination of frame size by the Metropolitan guidelines divided $\\mathtt{678}$ of the men and $^{628}$ of the women into the small frame category, $338$ of the men and 36% of the women into the medium frame category, and none of the men and $^{28}$ of the women into the large frame category. Two men could not be assigned a frame because they were taller than the maximum height provided by the tables. Of the 31% who did not have the same frame size by both methods, a small frame was observed for one method and a medium frame for the other. However, consistency was not noted in one method indicating a smaller frame.  \n\nKathch's method of measuring frame size was used to examine accuracy of self-appraisal or perception of frame size (32). Subjects were asked to rate their frame size and an expert rater also evaluated the 39 males and 33 females in their street clothes. The necessary measurements were taken to calculate frame size using the \"HAT\" frame size formula. The expert rater was in error $27.88$ of the time while self-appraisals erred 41. $78$ when responses were compared to the \"HAT\" calculations. When the self-appraisal responses were separated by sex, 35.9% of the men misjudged their frame size while 48.5% of the women misjudged their frame size.  \n\nIn an assessment of the 1083 Metropolitan tables, Hines and Bouchard examined the relationship between body frame and body fat (33). The authors noted that the inclusion of frame size assumes frame size provided an estimate of fat-free mass and measures of frame size had no association with body fat. To examine this assumption, 225 men and 212 women, ages 18-59, were measured for height, weight and six body breadths: shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, knee and ankle. Body density was determined by hydrostatic weighing, percent body fat was calculated using Siri's equation, and total fat weight and fat-free mass were derived from the percent body fat calculated and body weight. Fat-free mass was correlated with the measures of frame size to examine their relationship. Substantial correlation with each of the measures was found for both men and women.
