Some of these dimensions, such as the \nheight or the waist girth, are said to be easy-to-measure since it is possible to get them \neasily oneself with a tape measure by finding the associated key body points. However, \nother dimensions are difficult to obtain without the help of a professional stylist. Among \nthem we can cite for example the back width and length which are requested to the man -\nufacture of men’s shirts. Moreover, even with a professional measurement, we can find \nourselves faced with errors due to the variability of measurements between stylists.Abstract \nThe use of artificial intelligence to predict body dimensions rather than measuring \nthem by stylists or 3D scanners permits to obtain easily all measurements of individual \nconsumers and can consequently reduce costs of population survey campaigns. In \nthis paper, we have compared several models of machine learning to predict about 30 \nmeasurements used in fashion industry to construct clothes from 6 easy-to-measure \nbody dimensions and demographic information. The four types of models we have \nstudied are linear regressions, random forests, gradient boosting trees and support \nvector regressions. To construct and train them we have used anthropometric meas-\nurements of 9000 adult individuals of the French population collected by the French \nInstitute of Textiles and Clothing (IFTH) during a national measurement campaign col-\nlected between 2003 and 2005. We have analyzed the model prediction performance \nin terms of individual and global predictions as well as the effect of the training dataset \nsize and the importance of the input features. The linear and the support vector regres-\nsions have given the best results with respect to evaluation metrics, predicted distribu-\ntions and have required less training data than tree-based models. It turns out that the \nweight and height have been the most important input features for the models \nconsidered while the hip girth has been the less important among the input measure -\nments. Since the set of body dimensions used in fashion industry and the morphol-\nogy depend on the gender, we have decided to treat men and women separately \nand to compare them.\nKeywords: Artificial intelligence, Machine learning, Fashion and apparel industry, \nAnthropometric measurement, Sizing systemOpen Access\n© The Author(s) 2023.

Fashion and Textiles           (2023) 10:37 \nThe 3D scanning devices have been used by the textile industry to minimize errors \nwith manual measurements and to reduce their acquisition time. In general, 3D scan -\nning model the human body in the form of a mesh made up of points and triangles. \nSoftware such as Anthroscan from Human Solutions or 3D Measurement Software from \nProtoTech Solutions permit to extract up to 200 measurements of the human body from \na mesh. This extraction is usually performed by using computational geometry together \nwith landmarks placed on the subject body before the acquisition (Lu and Wang 2008) \nor more recently with deep learning-based methods (Kaashki et al. 2021). For a compre -\nhensive survey about 3D scanning technologies and the associated processing stages one \ncan read (Bartol et al. 2021).\nOn the other hand, Smartphone scanning applications have been developed in order \nto extract measurements. The principle is to position the device in front of the person so \nthat the phone camera collects pictures of the individual for the extraction. The technol -\nogies generally involved use computer vision, plane geometry (Hung et al. 2004), artifi -\ncial intelligence (Ashmawi et al. 2019; de Souza et al. 2020) and permit the user to obtain \nits body measurements in a limited number.\nThe ever-increasing development of artificial intelligence in recent years has allowed \nits application to many fields of the fashion and apparel industry. These methods include \nmachine learning, decision support system, expert system, optimization, image recogni -\ntion and vision and have given interesting results to the apparel manufacturing, apparel \ndesign, distribution and fabric production. Exhaustive reviews of the impact of these \ntechniques to this specific range of applications can be consulted in Guo et al. (2011) and \nGiri et al. (2019).\nThe aim of this paper is to apply artificial intelligence methods to facilitate the extrac -\ntion of measurements and to accurately predict full-body anthropometric measurements \nfrom a subset of easy-to-measure dimensions. Our approach is particularly interest -\ning to allow all measurements of individual consumers to be obtained from measure -\nments taken by themselves as well as to consequently reduce costs of population survey \ncampaigns.\nThe extraction of the individual customer body dimensions is helpful nowadays where \nthe internet shopping for clothes has become increasingly popular, especially since the \npandemic crisis. In practice, the user can measure some of its body dimensions and \ndeduce all of them with the help of artificial intelligence. Thus, he can buy on online \nclothing stores by filling in the measures in order to obtain clothes adapted as best as \npossible to its morphology.\nOn the other hand, since there is a substantial variation in body measurements \nbetween people, the usual method to provide accurate sizing charts of a population for \nthe garment pattern making is to survey a representative sample of the target popula -\ntion. These surveys generally include general information about the clothing habits and \nthe demographic characteristics of the individual surveyed together with the measure of \nits body sizes by stylists or by scanning them with 3D scanning devices. The implemen -\ntation of such campaigns can therefore require many professionals as well as advanced \ntechnology deployed across a territory or a country and is consequently very expensive. \nThus, the prediction of full-body anthropometric measurements can help to reduce sig -\nnificantly the complexity of the process of the survey and its costs. The idea is to collect \n\nPage 3 of 17\n Meyer et al. Fashion and Textiles           (2023) 10:37 \n \nonly some of the easy-to-measure key body dimensions and recover all of them with \nartificial intelligence. In these conditions, the survey can be conducted online where \nrespondents measure themselves with a tape or a scanning application even in pandemic \nsituations.\nIn this paper, we have used and compared different machine learning models to deduce \nall the necessary body dimensions for making all type of clothing (36 for women, 31 for \nmen) from 6 easy-to-measure body dimensions, such as the height or the waist girth and \ndemographic information. The machine learning models we have used are linear regres -\nsions, random forests, gradient boosting trees and support vector regressions. We have \ncomputed and compared their accuracies in terms of individual and global predictions. \nMoreover, we have studied the influence of the training dataset size and the importance \nof the input features in the model performance. To train and test our methods, we have \nused a database of 9000 adult individuals surveyed by French Institute of Textiles and \nClothing (IFTH) during a national measurement campaign between 2003 and 2005 with \nthe help of 3D scanning device from Human Solutions coupled with Anthroscan and \nprofessional stylists.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In “ General scheme” section we present the gen -\neral scheme of our work. The dataset and its preprocessing are presented in “ Anthropo -\nmetric data and preprocessing ” section and the models, their evaluation metrics and the \nassociated hyperparameters tuning in “Models, evaluation metrics and hyperparameters \ntuning ” section. The “Results” section reports the results about the comparison of the \nperformance of the models, the influence of the training dataset size and the importance \nof the input features. We discuss and interpret these results in “Discussion ” and we con -\nclude in “ Conclusion ” section.\nThe estimation of body measurements is intrinsically related to the study of propor -\ntions of the human body and is not only a problem considered within the framework of \nthe textile industry. The beginnings of this old subject can be found in the work of the \nroman architect of the first century BC Vitruvius in the first chapter titled “On Sym -\nmetry: In Temples And In The Human Body” of the book III of its treatise “De Archi -\ntectura” and its considerable influence on the architects and artists of the Renaissance.\nThe first modern statistical studies in this direction have been made by Rollet in \n1892 (Rollet 1892) and Pearson in 1899 (Pearson 1899) by the estimation of the human \nheight from its long bone lengths. This question also arises in the health sector and \nhas been particularly studied for the health of elderly people, where the measurements \ncan become difficult to measure because of the position required or the deformations \nof the skeleton. Chumea and other researchers have used several linear regressions to \npredict the height and/or the weight from the easy-to-measure knee height in Chumlea \net al. (1985) or Chumlea and Guo (1992) using the National Health Examination Survey \n(NHES) database (Gordon and Miller 1964).\nAfterward, the development of artificial intelligence encouraged many researchers \nto apply machine learning models to this problem. The analysis of correlation of body \ndimensions shows that there are important linear dependencies between them. Thus, \nin the literature, several studies have been conducted using linear machine learning \nmodels. For example in Indah et al. (2016), Indah et al. estimated 35 measurements \nof a small dataset of 45 elderly Javanese from age and body mass index by linear \n\nPage 4 of 17 Meyer et al. Fashion and Textiles           (2023) 10:37 \nregression models. The sex, height, weight and foot size have been predicted from \n22 hand related features from linear and logistic regression by Miguel-Hurtado et al. \n(2016).\nThe ever-increasing interest of the application of deep learning in industrial prob -\nlems led to several research studies applying artificial neural networks to apparel \nindustry problems. Liu et al. (2017) exposed that back propagation neural networks \nis accurate and stable in the prediction of 10 lower body dimensions from the height, \nhip and waist girths. Wang et al. (2019) showed that this type of neural network can \nbe outperformed by radial basis function artificial neural networks. They deduced 8 \nmeasurements from 4 easy-to-measure dimensions and studied the effect of the vol -\nume of the training dataset initially composed of 180 samples. In Wang et al. (2021), \ngeneralized regression neural networks have been used to predict 76 body measure -\nments from 7 easy-to-measure dimensions with the Anthropometric Survey of US \nArmy Personnel (ANSUR) II dataset (Gordon et al. 2014).\nIn order to take into account linear and non-linear aspects of body dimensions, Liu \net al. (2014) used a combination of multiple linear regression and radial basis function \nnetwork models to predict 60 body dimensions from 8 feature parameters. Similarly \n(Chan et al. 2005; AP et al. 2003) studied the relationship between men’s tailor-made \nshirt pattern parameters and body parameters with multiple linear regression and \nartificial neural networks. Rativa et  al. (2018) compared several machine learning \nregression models (support vector regression, Gaussian process and artificial neu -\nral network) to estimate the height and the weight from different groups of anthro -\npometric measurements on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey \n(NHANES) III (NCHS 1994) and the ANSUR datasets (Gordon et al. 1989).\nMethods\nIn this section we explain our approach to estimate body dimensions from a set of \neasy-to-measure measurements.\nGeneral scheme\nThe institute IFTH has identified in collaboration with several modelers 36 (respectively \n31) measurements for women (respectively men) that are needed for garment pattern \nmaking. These measurements are given in Table  1 together with precision steps and \nassociated units. The precision step of a measurement is defined as the acceptable error \nin measuring a measurement by a professional stylist. Among them, we have chosen \nthe six key easy-to-measure body dimensions which are the height, weight, chest/bust, \nwaist and hip girths and inside leg length as input features, see Fig.  1. They have the \nparticularity that they can be measured alone with a tape measure or with a scan appli -\ncation installed on a Smartphone. Additionally to these dimensions, we have included \ntwo demographic information, the age and the socioprofessional category, and the shoe \nsize of the individual. Then, four types of machine learning algorithms have been trained \nand tested on a dataset of a French national measurement campaign to predict the 30 \n(respectively 25) remaining measurements for women (respectively men).\n\nPage 5 of 17\n Meyer et al. Fashion and Textiles           (2023) 10:37 \n \nAnthropometric data and preprocessing\nIn this paper we have used a dataset composed of individuals of the French popula -\ntion collected by the institute IFTH in a national measurement campaign between \n2003 and 2005 by using 3D scanners. Each person is thus represented by standing and \nsitting meshes composed of around 400k vertices and 800k triangles. The software \nAnthroscan has been used to extract around 90 body measurements for each position. \nHence, about 180 measurements have been collected per individual together with Table 1 Measurements used in fashion industry according to the modelers of the French Institute \nof Textiles and Clothing (IFTH)\nMeasurements used in fashion industry for men and women Precision step Unit\nChest/bust girth 1 cm\nWaist girth 1 cm\nHigh hip girth 1 cm\nHip girth 1 cm\nThigh girth 0.5 cm\nKnee girth 0.5 cm\nCalf girth 0.5 cm\nAnkle girth 0.5 cm\nChest/bust width 0.5 cm\nBack width 0.5 cm\nHead girth 0.5 cm\nNeck girth 0.5 cm\nNeck base girth (suprasternal) 0.5 cm\nUpper arm girth 0.5 cm\nWrist girth 0.5 cm\nShoulder length (acromia—7th cervical vertebra) 1 cm\nLength of scye 1 cm\nBody rise 1 cm\nBack length (7th cervical-waist) 1 cm\nLeft shoulder slope (acromiale-neck base) 1 cm\nWaist height 1 cm\n7th cervical height 1 cm\nInside leg length 1 cm\nWaist-knee height 1 cm\nKnee-ground height 1 cm\nLeft arm length (acromia-wrist) 1 cm\nHead height (vertex-7th cervical) 1 cm\nFront lower trunk length 1 cm\nBack lower trunk length 1 cm\nHeight 1 cm\nWeight 1 kg\nAdditional measurements used in fashion industry for women Precision step Unit\nUnderbust girth 1 cm\nBustpoint length (neck base-bustpoint) 1 cm\nBustpoint-waist length 1 cm\nBustpoints breadth 0.5 cm\nLeft waist side length-ground 1 cm\n\nPage 6 of 17 Meyer et al.

The sample collected of size 11 500 is aged from 5 to 70 years. In \nthis work we have restricted the sample to the 9000 adults composed of 5000 women \nand 4000 men. Missing values in measurement features have been filled using a k-near -\nest neighbors algorithm with the Gower’s distance (Gower 1971). The continuous input \nvariables have all been standardized. The socioprofessional categorical nominal variable \nis a statistical nomenclature to classify professions of the French population created by \nthe National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (Insee). It defines seven groups \n(managers, students, employees, farmers/merchants, laborers, inactives and retirees) \nand it has been encoded by a one-hot-encoding forgetting one category (farmers/mer -\nchant) to avoid multicollinearity issues.\nModels, evaluation metrics and hyperparameters tuning\nIn this section we present the machine learning models used in this paper, the evalua -\ntion metrics considered and how we have chosen the associated hyperparameters. The \nmodels that have been compared for our regression tasks are linear regression models \n(LR), random forest models (RF), gradient boosting tree models (GB) and support vector \nregression models (SVR).\nThe random forest is an ensemble machine learning algorithm based on the use of \ncombination of multiple decision trees trained in parallel on randomly extracted subsets \nof the dataset. This algorithm can be used to solve regression problems by averaging the \npredictions of decision trees. Random forests are usually used on large datasets and have \nmuch better performance and fewer overfitting issues than decision trees. However, they \ncan have a high training time and are difficult to interpret (Ho 1995).\nGradient boosting trees is also an ensemble learning algorithm that can be used in \nregression and which is based on decision trees. This time, the trees are trained itera -\ntively by eliminating the errors of the previous trees. This model is generally more accu -\nrate than random forests but unfortunately once again hard to interpret (Breiman 1997).\nThe important idea behind support vector machine models is to map the dataset \ninto high-dimensional space where it is easier to perform regression analysis. To this \nend kernel functions are used and permit non-linear analysis. These models are robust \nFig. 1 The 6 easy-to-measure key body measurements\n\nPage 7 of 17\n Meyer et al. Fashion and Textiles           (2023) 10:37 \n \nprediction methods and produce significant accuracy than models based on decision \ntrees with less computation time (Cortes and Vapnik 1995).\nTo evaluate the prediction accuracy of the models, we have used the average mean \nabsolute error (MAE) defined by\nwhere x=(x1,...,xn) and y=(y1,...,yn) are n-dimensional vectors, and we have eval -\nuated it between the real test values y and the predicted values x by a model. This metric \nhas been used to be compared with the precision steps given in Table  1. The precision \nratio PR of a measurement is defined to be the ratio between the MAE associated to the \nbest model and the precision step of the measurement, that is to say:\nwhere y is a measurement of Table  1, PS(y) is its precision step, ˆm is a trained model \nwhere m∈models  , Xtest is the input test matrix and ytest is the real test values.\nThe machine learning algorithms considered in this work have a wide range of hyper -\nparameters with significant effects on the performances of models that we have tuned \nwith bayesian optimization methods. This method comes from global optimization the -\nory (Mockus et al. 1978) and is applicable to the problem of minimizing a scalar-valued \nfunction which is costly to evaluate. This approach has been applied to solve machine \nlearning problems where the function is an evaluation metric of a model. This optimi -\nzation method has better results and is much faster than the grid and random search \ncross-validations.\nHence we have used bayesian optimization to tune hyperparameters of the RF, GB and \nSVR models by minimizing the evaluation metric MAE. The hyperparameters that we \nhave considered to tune the RF and GB models are the number and the maximum depth \nof trees, the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node and to be at \na leaf node. For the SVR model the hyperparameters tuned are the kernel function, its \ncoefficient γ , the regularization parameter and the epsilon-tube in which no penalty is \nassociated in the training loss function.\nResults\nModel prediction performance\nWe have trained the machine learning models considered in “Models, evaluation met -\nrics and hyperparameters tuning ” to estimate each key measurement used in fashion \nindustry (see Table  1) from our input features separating men from women. To this \nend we have split the dataset into two sets, one set to train the algorithms and another \nset to test the algorithms, following a 70–30% division.

For both the RF and GB models, except for the maximum \ndepth of trees, the average of the hyperparameters obtained are similar. We have \nobtained on average 550 trees, and 6 minimum of samples required to split an inter -\nnal node and to be at a leaf node. However the maximum depth of trees is on average \n14 for the RF models while 5 for the GB models. The tuning of the hyperparameters of \nthe SVR models give on average 58 for the regularization parameter, 0.72 for the epsi -\nlon-tube and 10.64 for the γ coefficient.

Then our 4 models have been \ntrained with bayesian optimization hyperparameter tuning and tested on these sub -\nsets. To illustrate this in Fig.  2 we have shown it for the measurement waist-knee \nheight for women which is a well-estimated measurement.\nFeatures importance\nThe permutation feature importance measures the importance of the input features \nof a model by calculating the increase in the model’s prediction error after ran -\ndomly shuffling the feature. A feature is said to be important if permuting its values \nincreases the model error. This notion was introduced in Breiman (2001) for random \nforests and in Fisher et al. (2019) for a general model.\nWe now explain how to calculate the permutation feature importance. For a \ntrained model ˆm where m∈models  , the input test matrix Xtest , a column feature j  in \nXtest and the target test feature ytest:\n• We compute the error metric MAE (ytest ,ˆm(Xtest));\n• We define the matrix Xtest ,perm  to be the matrix Xtest where the column feature j \nhas been randomly permuted;\n• We compute the associated error metric MAE (ytest ,ˆm(Xtest ,perm ));\n• We calculate the permutation feature importance FIj of j by \nIn Table  5 we have presented the means of permutation feature importances along \nall measurements for all models and in Table  6 we have counted the number of \nmeasurements where each feature is the most important.(4) FIj=MAE (ytest ,ˆm(X test))−MAE (ytest ,ˆm(X test ,perm )).\nFig. 2 MAE of the models trained by datasets with various sizes for the waist-knee height measurement for \nwomen.

Fashion and Textiles           (2023) 10:37 \nDiscussion\nWe have obtained that, for both genders, all measurements are estimated with a MAE \nand a precision ratio smaller than 3.6 and that models have similar performances. Meas -\nurements can have different prediction accuracies depending on the gender, for example \nthe knee girth has a precision ratio of 2.45 for women and 2.10 for men. For both gen -\nders, the five same measurements have a precision ratio less than 1 and almost exactly \nin the same order, these measurements are given in Fig.  3. The three least well estimated \nmeasurements are the same for women and men and are given in Fig.  3. One can see \nthat neck measurements are not easily obtainable by our models.

The linear and the support vector regressions \nhave an average MAE between 1.25 and 1.3% and are therefore better than the models \nbased on decision trees which have an average MAE between 1.3 and 1.4%. For almost \nall measurements LR and SVR models are better than RF and GB models.\nThe computation of KL divergences in our case have corroborated the previous discus -\nsion and the results of “Model prediction performance” section since we have obtained \nFig. 3 The five best estimated measurements by the models for both genders in figures (a) to (e).

Fashion and Textiles           (2023) 10:37 \nthat the LR and SVR models have better distributions than the RF and GB models. We \nnote that this time the men have slightly better results than women contrary to results \nwith the metric MAE. To illustrate this we have shown in Fig.  4 the boxplots and the \ndensity estimations of the predicted values by the models compared to the real test \nvalues of the bustpoint-waist length for women which is one of the less well estimated \nmeasurements.\nMoreover, the effect of the training dataset size is almost always the same for both gen -\nders and all measurements. One can see that the LR and SVR models rapidly have good \nresults with an important stability while the RF and GB models need a more important \ndataset size and have rather unstable results. This instability is certainly due to the fact \nthat these two models have a part of randomness in their construction and learning. For \nthe LR and SVR models, it turns out that to obtain good results we have needed a data -\nset of size approximately 500. One of the only measurements having a different behavior \nby evaluating its model prediction performance metric along different training dataset \nsizes is the upper arm girth. This particularity is more pronounced for the men dataset \nwhere we have that the RF model has better result than the LR and SVR models and con -\ntinue to improve without stabilization, see Fig. 5.\nWe have also studied the evolution of the KL divergence of the density estimations \nbetween the real values of the test set and the predicted values by our models when \nincreasing the size of the training datasets and the results are very similar to the evolu -\ntion of the MAE.\nIt turns out that, even if the weight and height have the most influence for both \nsexes, the weight is the most important input feature for women while the height \nis the most important feature for men. The inside leg length, the chest/bust, waist \nand hip girths have more influence for women than for men. It is shared for both \ngenders and all models that the inside leg length, the chest/bust and waist girths are \nmore important than the hip girth. It is interesting to note that the only measure -\nment for which the hip girth is the most important feature is the thigh girth for the \nRF model and both sexes and that this measurement has the particularity to be not \nFig. 5 MAE of the models trained by datasets with various sizes for the upper arm girth measurement for \nmen. LR: linear regression. RF: random forest. GB: gradient boosting. SVR: support vector regression\n\nPage 15 of 17\n Meyer et al. Fashion and Textiles           (2023) 10:37 \n \nwell estimated in terms of evaluation metrics (see Tables  2 and 3 ) while having good \ndistribution results (see Table  4). The age, the shoe size and the socioprofessional cat -\negory don’t have much importance. We also see that the LR model is less stable than \nthe other ones with respect to the variation of the inputs while tree based models are \nmore resistant.\nThe only measurement for which the age is the most important input feature is \nthe left shoulder slope (acromiale-neck base) for the model RF (respectively GB) for \nwomen (respectively men) and is the most difficult measurement to predict for both \ngenders (see Tables 2 , 3 and 4 ).\nConclusions\nIn this article, we have compared linear regressions, random forests, gradient boost -\ning trees and support vector regressions to predict about thirty measurements used \nin fashion industry to construct clothes from 6 easy-to-measure body dimensions and \ndemographic information. Our work shows that for both genders the models have \ngood prediction accuracies and distributions. More precisely, the average MAE per \nmodel is less than 1.4 and is slightly better for women than for men, while the KL \ndivergences between test values and predicted values in the test set are inferior to \n0.03 and are slightly better for men than for women. The results suggest to use lin -\near and support vector regressions to estimate body dimensions. These models have \nbetter MAE and distribution results, they generally need only 500 samples to be cor -\nrectly trained and are more stable than tree-based models. It turns out that girth \nmeasurements are more difficult to estimate than height measurements. The study \nof the importance of the input features indicates that for both genders, the clothing \nhabits and the demographic characteristics are not important and that the weight and \nheight have the most influence for the models considered while the hip girth is the \nless important among the input measurements. This result is positive since it is much \neasier to measure its weight and height rather than the hip girth which is often con -\nfused with the high hip girth. Actually we have that the weight is the most important \nfeature for women while the height is the most important feature for men. It is shown \nin the literature that artificial neural networks have efficient results to predict body \ndimensions. Hence, future research can be conducted to compare the models used in \nthis work with deep learning models and study their individual and global prediction \nresults and the influence of the input features and training dataset size.\nAbbreviations\nGB  Gradient boosting\nIFTH  French Institute of Textiles and Clothing\nKL  Kullback–Leibler\nLR  Linear regression\nMAE  Mean absolute error\nPR  Precision ratio\nPS  Precision step\nRF  Random forest\nSVR  Support vector regression\nUTT   Université de Technologie de Troyes\nAcknowledgements\nNot applicable.\n\nPage 16 of 17 Meyer et al.
