Abstract
Objective 
This report presents anthropometric reference data for 
the U.S. population age 2 years and older during August 2021–August 2023. 
Methods 
Body measurements were obtained from 8,545 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) participants age 2 years and older during  
August 2021–August 2023. Measurements included weight, height, circumferences, and limb lengths. 
Results 
Weighted population means, standard errors of the means, and selected percentiles of body measurement values are reported for participants age 2 years and older. Body measurement results are shown by sex and age. 
Conclusions 
These nationally representative NHANES data show the distribution of measured weight, height, body mass index, circumferences, and lengths in the U.S. population during August 2021–August 2023. 
Keywords: anthropometry • body measures • nutrition

Introduction 
Anthropometry, the science of measuring human body dimensions, serves as a key indicator of nutritional status, overall health, dietary sufficiency, and growth patterns. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) provides nationally representative, in-person body measurement data collected through the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the primary source of body measurement information for the U.S. population. These measurements offer insights into the average weight, height, length, and circumferences of U.S. children, adolescents, and adults. Previous reports by NCHS have detailed anthropometric reference tables that describe the distribution of various body measurements within the U.S. population during 1988–2018 (1–6). This report presents updated anthropometric reference data collected through NHANES from August 2021 to August 2023 for age 2 years and older by sex and age.Methods 
NHANES, conducted by NCHS, collects data in household interviews followed by health examinations in mobile examination centers (MECs). The MECs are staffed by full-time personnel, including health technicians who perform body measurements on survey participants using a standard protocol. 
Surveys were conducted on a periodic basis from 1960 to 
1994. NHANES became a continuous survey in 1999 and continued through March 2020, when data collection was paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic. NHANES data collection resumed in August 2021 using a new sample design to reduce contact between interviewers and survey participants during the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. The 2-year public-use data files for August 2021–August 2023 were used for this report (7–9). During this survey period, the overall examination response rate was 25.6%. 

NATIONAL CENTER FOR HEALTH STATISTICS  2 Series 3, Number 50Sample Description 
NHANES is a complex, multistage probability sample of the 
civilian noninstitutionalized U.S. population. The NHANES August 2021–August 2023 sample included participants of all ages (9). Due to small sample sizes for some body measurements, only those age 2 years and older are included in this report. The analytic sample for this report was based on the August 2021–August 2023 examined sample of 8,545 people age 2 years and older. Pregnant females were excluded from the tabulations of weight, body mass index (BMI), and circumference measurements. 
Age for adults was categorized into 10-year age groups and 
age 80 and older. For participants ages 2–19 years, results were reported by 2-year age groups. This is a change from previous anthropometric reports that were based on 4 years of NHANES data and a corresponding larger sample size, with results for children and adolescents shown by single year of age.
Body Measures 
The NHANES Anthropometry Procedures Manual describes the protocol, equipment, quality control, and measurement procedures in detail (10). All NHANES participants were eligible for the anthropometry examination component, although not all age groups were eligible for all measurements. A list of body measures by age eligibility, collected by NHANES from 1999–2000 through August 2021–August 2023, is included in Appendix Table I. 
Weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kilogram using a digital floor scale. 
Upper arm length was measured with a tape measure 
from the posterior border of the acromion process to the tip of the olecranon process; during the measurement, the upper arm length midpoint was marked. The mid-arm circumference was measured with a tape measure at the marked point. Upper arm length and mid-arm circumference were measured to the nearest 0.1 centimeter. 
Standing height or stature and waist circumference were 
measured to the nearest 0.1 centimeter on participants. Standing height was measured with a wall-mounted stadiometer. Waist circumference was measured with a tape measure at the uppermost lateral border of the hip crest (ilium).
Upper leg length was measured on participants age 8 
and older. Upper leg measurements to the nearest 0.1 centimeter were taken on seated participants; the distance from the inguinal crease to the distal end of the femur was measured. Hip circumference was measured to the nearest 0.1 centimeter on participants age 12 years and older. 
Weight and standing height values were recorded 
automatically. The other body measurement data were recorded using computer-assisted data entry. All results were based on a single body measurement examination. 
One index is reported, BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms 
divided by height in meters squared (kg/m
2). BMI is often 
used to define obesity.
Statistical Analysis 
Unweighted sample sizes and weighted means, standard errors, and selected percentiles were estimated. Data were weighted using examination sample weights to produce national estimates. The NHANES examination sample weights incorporate the differential probabilities of selection and include adjustments for noncoverage and nonresponse. Standard errors were estimated using SUDAAN by Taylor series linearization because of the complex sample design (11). 
All estimates of means and percentiles were considered 
statistically reliable based on not having less than 8 degrees of freedom or a relative standard error greater than 30%. Although NCHS now uses new criteria for presentation of proportions (12), similar criteria for means and percentiles have not been established. Estimates with standard errors for the percentile that could not be calculated using SUDAAN were omitted from the tables and are identified with a dagger (†).
Results 
A list of detailed tables with distributions for the various body measurements and BMI is found in the tex t Table.  
Tables 1–20 contain the sample size, mean, standard error, and selected percentiles for the different measures. Results are reported by sex and age group. For example, during  
August 2021–August 2023, the average man age 20 and older weighed 199 pounds (Table 4) and was 68.9 inches (just under 5 feet 9 inches) tall (Table 8). The average woman age 20 and older weighed about 172 pounds (171.8) (Table 4) 
and was 63.5 inches (5 feet 3.5 inches) tall ( Table 8). Results 
from previous surveys conducted from 1960 to 2018 for most measurements have been reported (1–6,13–24). A historical summary of published body measurement reference data is available in  Appendix Table II. 
Discussion 
This report presents the latest anthropometric reference data for U.S. children and adults. This is the first time since NHANES III (1988–1994) that hip circumference measurements have been included in the report. 
Reference data derived from anthropometric measurements 
are widely used. The anthropometric data collected through NHANES are used for various applications, including public health research, health and safety policy formulation, 

Series 3, Number 50 3 NATIONAL CENTER FOR HEALTH STATISTICSclinical practices, and product development (25–32). These measurements serve 
as critical references for understanding population health trends and informing interventions aimed at improving health outcomes in adults and youth.
