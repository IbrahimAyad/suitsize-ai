Please note that our tailor will \nneed to add allowances to your body measurements depending on your body profile. ) \n 1. NECK  \nMeasure around the lower part of your neck, \nplacing a finger between the tape measure and \nthe neck. You should not feel restricted by the \ntape for a comfortable fit, and should be able to \nput your index finger inside the tape.  \n 2. CHEST  \nMeasure around the fullest part of the chest. \nThe measuring tape is usually around the \nnipple level, under the armpits, and over your \nshoulder blades . Do not overinflate your chest \nbut stand normally;  you should be able to fit \nyour index finger in between the tape and your \nchest.  \n\n 3. STOMACH  \nMeasure around the widest part of your \nabdomen, placing a finger between yo ur body \nand the tape. Make sure the tape is at the \nsame height at all times. The widest part of the \nabdomen usually coincides with the belly \nbutton. Do not hold your stomach in.  \n 4. WAIST  \nWearing trousers and a shirt put the measuring \ntape around your waist  at the height were you \nwould wear your pants and adjust to your \ndesigned snugness with room for a finger. \nMake sure the tape is snug and does not ride \nover the waistband but you should be able to \nput your index finger inside the tape.  \n \nAs a guide, this m easurement will be about 2 \ninches above what you take off -the-rack as \nthey like to flatter, but unfortunately we need \nreal measurements.  \n 5. HIPS  \nWearing trousers, measure around the fullest \npart of your hips, placing a finger between your \nbody and the tape . Make sure the tape is \nstraight at all times.  \nMake sure your pockets are empty and the \ntape is not restrictive. As a guide, you should \nnot make the tape too snug. You only just be \nable to feel the tape when measuring.  \n\n 6. SHOULDER  \nMeasure across the top of  the shoulder from \none edge to the other. Ensure you take the \ncurved contour over the top of the shoulders as \nshown.  \nWearing your best fitted shirt or suit measure \nup to the shoulder seams.  \n 7. JACKET LENGTH  \nMeasure from the highest part of your shoulder \n(where shoulder and neck seams meet) all the \nway down to the desired length, usually around \nthe thumb joint. When measuring, adopt an \nupright position with both arms on your sides.  \nA shorter, trendier length, looks good when \ncoupled with jeans, but is an ac quired taste in \na suit.  \n 8. SLEEVE LENGTH  \nWearing a shirt that you like, measure with arm \nat your side, from the shoulder's seam all \nalong the arm until you find the desired length. \nYour measurement will be the length of your \njacket sleeve.  \nWe recommend th at the sleeve should go to \nthe base of your thumb (located at the wrist \njoint ). \n\n 9. BICEP  \nMeasure around your upper arm at the widest \npoint when flexed leaving one finger of space \nto take the measure.  \n 10.  WRIST  \nMeasure around your wrist bone leaving one \nfinger of space to take the measure.  \n 11.  CROTCH  \nMeasure from the top middle of the back pants \nwaist (see point A) all along the crotch seam \nthrough your legs until the top of front waist \n(see point B)  \n \nImportant: If you have any doubt, compare this \nmeasure w ith pants that fit you well.  \n\n 12.  THIGH WIDTH  \nWearing trousers, empty your pockets then, \nStart at the top of your inseam, measure \naround your thigh with room for a finger.  \n \n 13.  PANTS LENGTH  \nMeasure from the top of pants waist all along \nthe side pant seam un til the bottom of your \npants or roughly 1 inch from the ground.  \n 14.  INSEAM  \nMeasure from the lowest part of your crotch \narea to the floor.  \nMake sure the tape is tight along the inside of \nyour leg, that you are standing straight, and \nthen measure.  \nNo shoes  please !", "files_in_pdf": []}
