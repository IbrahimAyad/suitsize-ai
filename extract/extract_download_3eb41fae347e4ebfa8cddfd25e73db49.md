Abstract
Purpose –The purpose of this study was to categorize the whole body shapes of overweight and obese
females in the US and examine apparel fit based on the current ASTM sizing standards related to the body
shapes categorized.
Design/methodology/approach –Body scan data from 2,672 subjects were used. To categorize their whole
body shapes using 97 body measurements, principal component analysis with varimax rotation, a hierarchical
cluster analysis and K-means cluster analysis were used. To compare the ASTM sizing standards for plus sizes
(curvy and straight) and missy sizes (curvy and straight), five body parts (bust, under bust, waist, top hip, hip)using the formula for fit tolerance (measurement plus half of the interval) were compared with the ASTM sizing
standards to determine the size appropriate for each body part.
Findings –Five whole body shapes among overweight and obese females in the US were categorized:
Rectangle-curvy; parallelogram-moderately curvy; parallelogram-hip tilt; inverted trapezoid-moderately curvy
and inverted trapezoid-hip tilt. When the body measurements in each body shape were compared with the
current ASTM sizing systems for both misses and plus sizes, four-fifths or more of overweight and obesefemale adults in the US would find it difficult to obtain a perfect fit for both tops and bottoms.
Originality/value –Identifying whole body shapes among overweight and obese women in the US
contributes significantly, as it will help apparel companies that target the markets of larger women develop anew sizing system. This study is the first attempt to analyze fit by comparing the ASTM sizing charts with
body measurements in each body shape group. Further, the study contributes to the body-related literature by
filling gaps in missing whole BS categories among overweight and obese females.

Introduction
The number of Americans who are obese and overweight has increased alarmingly, such that
approximately 39.8% of adults are obese and 31.8% are overweight ( Center for Disease
Control and Prevention, 2016 ). Excessive weight and obesity are defined as “...abnormal and
excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health ”(WHO.int, 2020 ). The body mass
index (BMI), which is an important indicator of chronic diseases, including diabetes,
cardiovascular diseases and cancer ( WHO.int, 2020 ), is used to measure whether one is
overweight (BMI of 25 and below 30) or obese (BMI of 30 and above).
Excessive weight causes significant body changes and clothing fit problems for
overweight and obese (OWOB) women for two reasons: (1) The amounts of fat deposited on
particular body areas (e.g. bust, waist, thigh) are significantly higher than on non-OWOB
women ( Johnston et al. , 1988 ), and (2) although plus-size women ’s clothing is a $21 billionOverweight

industry, few apparel companies focus on plus-sized female consumers ( Meyersohn, 2018 )
despite the significantly large number of OWOB adults in the US thus, exploring the
characteristics of OWOB adults ’body shapes would help improve the sizing system and new
product development process for larger women.
Some studies have shown the relations between excessive fat accumulation and changes
in body geometry and posture ( Berriganet et al., 2006 ;Fabris De Souza et al., 2005 ).Berriganet
et al. (2006) found that obesity caused postural instability that constrained goal-directed
movements and daily activities, such as “...upper limb movements performed from an
upright standing position ”(p. 1,750). Further, morbidly obese individuals usually have
scoliosis and increased thoracic kyphosis and hyperlordosis, which cause anteversion of the
head. Given the changes in body shapes (BSs) fat accumulation causes, OWOB female
consumers ’BSs differ from the BS that has been used to create the sizing standard in the
fashion industry. However, there is the lack of understanding of OWOB female ’
anthropometric characteristics and BSs ( Park and Park, 2013 ).
With limited studies on fit problems in clothing in general among larger women, researchers
focused on investigating fit problems in specific clothing categories, such as intimate wear
(Bishop et al., 2018 ), swimwear ( Christel and O ’Donnell, 2016 ) and exercise apparel ( Greenleaf
et al.,2 0 2 0 ). OWOB females ’inability to find clothing that fits well often makes them feel they
are socially inferior because of the unequal accessibility to clothing that fits well ( Bishop et al.,
2018), and thus they may feel frustrated and rejected by the fashion industry ( Otieno et al., 2005 ;
Scaraboto and Fischer, 2013 ). Furthermore, individuals who experienced poor fit tend to have
more negative body image and greater body dissatisfaction than those with greater fit
satisfaction ( LaBat and DeLong, 1990 ). Hence, apparel companies have considered improving
their size standards that affect OWOB female consumers ’self-identity and social status ( Bishop
et al.,2 0 1 8 ). For example, leading retailers (e.g. Walmart, Nike and Adidas) developed and sold
plus-sized lines for size inclusivity ( Ashley, 2020 ). However, because there have been limited
studies attempting to understand BSs related fit problems in clothing in general among larger
women, improving fit for OWOB women has not been an easy task for apparel companies. This,
a continuous effort on the part of fashion companies, is needed to extend beyond size inclusivity
by attempting to understand larger BSs.
To help fashion companies provide their OWOB female consumers with improved fit and
sizes, identifying their whole BS considering upper and lower bodies together would be an
important step to determine the reasons why they experience ill-fitting clothes. OWOB femaleconsumers ’difficulties with fit and size may be attributable to the fact that their BSs differ
from the standardized BS used to make sizing charts in the current fashion industry
(Sokolowski et al., 2020 ). However, researchers have conducted several studies to understand
the BSs of females in the US ( Song and Ashdown, 2011 ) and larger females in South Korea
(
Park and Park, 2013 ).Song and Ashdown (2011) provided data on a wide BMI range of
women ’s body measurements between BMIs of 16.2 and 34.1 (aged between 18 and 35) that
were included to identify the lower BS of women. Thus, their results cannot be applicable to
OWOB women ’s BSs because they included underweighted and normal weighted women.
Further, a person ’s whole body is not limited to the lower body, but consists of the upper and
lower bodies combined. For example, a woman can have a curvy lower body with a thin upper
body, while another can have both a curvy lower and upper body. These two should not be
categorized into the same whole BS. Although Park and Park (2013) categorized BSs among
larger women in South Korea, their results also cannot be generalized for use with OWOB
women in the US because females ’body proportions are different between the US and South
Korea ( Leeet al., 2007 ). To address these gaps, the purpose of this study was to categorize the
whole BSs of OWOB females in the US and examine apparel fit based on the current ASTM
sizing standards related to the BSs categorized. In the initial stage of identifying the whole BS,
it is necessary to include OWOB women in a wide age range, from 18 to 55 years. Thus, weJFMM

used the SizeUSA database, “...a large representative database of measurements of US
women ”(Song and Ashdown, 2011 , p. 916), and included data on OWOB women with a BMI
of 25 or over aged between 18 and 55 years to address the following two research questions:
RQ1. What are the representative whole BSs among OWOB females in the US?
RQ2. How accurately do the current ASTM sizing standards reflect the whole BSs
identified among OWOB females in the US?
This study ’s implications include the fact that understanding the whole BSs among
OWOB female consumers will help fashion com panies update sizing charts to meet their
customers ’needs for various BSs not limited to hourglass and standardized BSs among
consumers with normal weight. Consequently, this will benefit both OWOB female
consumers and fashion companies: Consumers may have fewer fit and size problems that
cause them to feel socially inferior, while apparel companies will receive economic
benefits with fewer returns and exchanges c aused by problems with ill-fitting clothes
(Faust and Carrier, 2010 ).
Literature review
Overweight, obese and fat distribution
There are two types of fat distribution in obesity: The android and gynoid shapes ( Vague,
1956). The android shape is referred to as upper or central obesity ( Lefebvre et al., 1997 ). This
shape has a waist-to-hip ratio (WHR; an indicator used to measure fat distribution around the
waist, Ashwell, 2009 ) greater than 0.8 with excessive subcutaneous fat accumulated
particularly on the trunk. The gynoid shape is defined as gluteo-femoral obesity, in which
one ’s WHR is less than 0.8 with excessive fat in the abdominal visceral area. It is also referred
to as gynoid obesity or lower obesity and is observed primarily in women.
Ashwell (2009) introduced the Ashwell®Shape Chart that shows the relation between
waist measurements and height and categorizes them into four categories depending upon
the level of health risk. If the WHtR is less than 0.4, it is considered the brown “chili ”category.
If the WHtR is between 0.4 and 0.5, it is in the green “pear ”category. If the individual ’s WHtR
is between 0.5 and 0.6, it is in the yellow “pear-apple ”category. If the individual ’s WHtR is
greater than 0.6, he/she is in the red “apple ”category.
Body shape categorization and 3D body scanning technology
Connell et al. (2006) developed the Body Shape Assessment Scale (BSAS©), which included
female ’s whole BS from the front view and side view. Female ’s whole BS from the front view is
categorized into five shapes based on shoulder (the end of shoulders), waist and the widest
points between the waist and crotch, the circle, pear, rectangle, inverted triangle and
hourglass measured on a 1 –5 scale between two BSs.
To evaluate female ’s whole BS from the side view of the body, bust shapes (l or r), front
torso shapes (b, B or D) between the bust and below waist, buttocks shapes (Low Hook or
Even Arch) and back shape (upper back, middle back and lower back) are rated from 1, very
flat, to 5, very prominent (or full for back shape: Connell et al., 2006 ). In addition, Connell et al.
(2006) considered posture to be one of the important scales in the BSAS©. They revised
Douty ’s Posture Scale ( Jones, 1972 ) based on 3D body scan data: Aligned, forward alignment
and compensating alignment.
August (1981) also described two variations in bust shapes, either flat ( “l”shape) or
prominent ( “r”shape) and two variations in buttocks shape, “Low Hook ”and “Even Arch. ”
The Low Hook shape has a flat line from the waist until it curves under the crotch line, while
the Even Arch shape has a symmetrically rounded line from immediately below the waistline
to the crotch line. In the back shape, August (1981) noted that back curvature from below theOverweight

women ’s body
shape and fit

neck to immediately above the waist depends upon where the curvature is concentrated, in
the upper back (from below the neck to the top of the arm), middle back (primary fullness in
the curvature up to the mid arm level) and lower back (primary fullness below the underarm).
Although August (1981) andConnell et al. (2006) have defined the body ’s silhouette and
profile for the separate parts of the body, the methods used to categorize BSs are difficult to
apply to a traditional pattern-making method because separated body projections depending
on the views can result in several possible BSs ( Song and Ashdown, 2011 ). For example,
females with “r”bust shape can have three different buttocks shapes.
To overcome the issues, Song and Ashdown (2011) developed a new and more holistic
method than others to categorize BSs, whic hc o m b i n e df r o n ta n ds i d ev i e wo fb o d yu s i n g
body measurements that can directly apply t o the pattern-making process. Using body
measurements extracted from 3D body scann ing technology, they categorized female ’s
lower BSs among 18 –35-year-old females with a BMI of 34.1 or less. They used principal
component analysis (PCA) to reduce the numbe r of factors that used to categorize BSs by
combining similar body measurements into the same factor of a principal component. The
identified five factors of principal componen ts were two silhouettes (waist to top hip and
top hip to full hip silhouette), two promine nces in the buttocks and abdomen areas and
the slope from the abdomen point to front hip point. The researchers found three
lower BSs among 2,488 young female parti cipants, straight, tilted and curvy ( Song and
Ashdown, 2011 ).
Song et al. (2021) recently categorized four upper body shapes using 3D body scan data
among a total of 423 females (ages between 40 and 69) in the United States. The researchers
followed the same procedures of body shape categorization that were used in the previous
study ( Song and Ashdown, 2011 ), which included PCA and cluster analysis. There were eight
factors that determined the aged females ’upper body shapes: acromial inclination, upper
body slope, neck inclination, waist depth, shoulder angle, overall body length, upper back
curvature and back protrusion height ( Song et al., 2021 ).
Daniell et al. (2014) also used 3D body scans (i.e. the Vitus Smart whole-body scanner by
Human Solutions) to examine the relations between body volumes and BMI among female
and male adults. Particularly for overweigh t and obese female adults, as BMI increased, the
volumes of the pelvic (stomach above waist li ne in our study) and abdominal areas (from
waist line to crotch in our study) increased at a significantly greater rate than did the whole
body volume. For females with a BMI of up t o approximately 32, the body volume in the
abdominal areas increased significantly an d resulted in a pear-shaped body, while for
females with a BMI of above approximatel y 33, the body volume in the stomach areas
increased sharply and resulted in an apple shape ( Daniell et al., 2014 ).
There were two studies on the whole BS categorization among South Korean women. Park
and Park (2013) used 3D body scan data from 1,327 females in South Korea to categorize the
whole BS among Korean OWOB women whose aged between 10s and 60s. Through the
factor analysis and cluster analysis, there were four BSs: (1) Large torso and below-average
shoulder width, (2) wide shoulder and below-average lower body, (3) small torso and large
lower body and (4) small figure. Yu and Kim (2020) recently analyzed 3D anthropometric
characteristics to categorize BSs among middle-aged women aged 40 to 59 ( n5302) with
normal weight range (not including overweight and obese) in South Korea.
Although there has been a study on the whole BS categorization among larger women
(Park and Park, 2013 ) and women with normal weight range ( Yu and Kim, 2020 ) in South
Korea, their results regarding the whole BSs cannot be generalized for OWOB women in the
US To address the knowledge gap, we categorized the whole BSs and examined how
accurately the current ASTM sizing standards meet the categorized whole BSs for OWOB
women in the US.JFMM

Methods
The SizeUSA data are a nationwide anthropometric data in the US ( [TC]2, n.d. ), females with a
BMI of 25 or higher and aged between 18 and 55 were used in this study. The ages of a total of
2,672 subjects were categorized into four groups (18 –25 years old: 748, 28%; 26 –35 years old:
422, 15.8%; 36 –45 years old: 821, 30.7% and 46 –55 years old: 681, 25.5%). Approximately
one-half (1,188, 44.5%) were non-Hispanic Caucasians, followed by non-Hispanic African
Americans (679, 25.4%), Mexican Hispanics (241, 9.0%), others (226, 8.5%), non-Mexican
Hispanics (217, 8.1%) and Asians (121, 4.5%). The participants ’BMI ranged from 25.01 to
69.97. A total of 1401 (52.4%) were overweight (BMI of 25 to <30) and 1,271 (47.6%) were
obese (BMI of 30 or higher).
We followed Park and Park (2013) andSong and Ashdown (2011) ’s study in the whole BS
categorization process ( RQ1). In addition to the list of body measurements, the body scan data
in a.rbd format provided with the SizeUSA data were used to extract additional body
measurements (i.e. width, and front and back points from body ’s side view to calculate
depths) using the [TC]2 software. Following the previous studies ( Park and Park, 2013 ;Song
and Ashdown, 2011 ), a total of 97 body measurements were included initially to select shape-
defining measurements, including 58 raw body measurements (i.e. full girth, front/back arc,
width, full depth, length and height) and 39 drop values between the raw body measurements
(i.e. drop values for girth, front/back arc, width and depth). For example, the depth drop
values were calculated based on the raw measurements and the differences between the side
seam depth (formula by Song and Ashdown, 2011 ) and front and back depths at the bust,
waist, abdomen and hip levels. In addition, the back arc at each body level was obtained by
subtracting the front arc from the full girth. Through bivariate correlations, 13 measurements
(4 raw measurements and 9 drop values) related to BSs were identified regardless of body
size, which had significantl y low correlations with each other. After deleting six
measurements that had no significant co rrelations with weight, all of the raw
measurements showed significant, low correlations between each factor and weight that
ranged from /C00.29 to 0.22. To reduce the number of variables and combine similar variables
into appropriate dimensions, PCA with varimax rotation ( Hair et al., 1995 ) was used. Any
items loadings less than 0.5 and with multiple loadings on two or more variables were
removed ( Hair et al., 1995 ). Based on the variables identified from PCA, a hierarchical cluster
analysis with the Ward ’s method and K-means cluster analysis were conducted to specify the
possible number of BSs for the OWOB women. To verify differences from one another in thecategorized BS, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc multiple comparison
tests were employed to compare the mean value of each cluster that represents the BS. Then,
the whole BSs identified for the OWOB women were compared among the different ages,
ethnicities and BMI groups using a cross-tabulation analysis with chi-square test.
To define and name each categorized BS, we visually assessed the whole BSs using CLO
software. Through CLO software, a virtual body model for each BS was created to evaluate
the whole BS visually. Further, Adobe Illustrator was used to draw the lines for front and side
body silhouettes (black lines shown in Figure 1 ) based upon the width and depth
measurements for the bust, waist, top hip and hip areas. For the front body silhouette, we
used width measurements for the bust, waist, top hip and hip areas while depth
measurements for the four areas were used to draw the side body silhouette. After
overlapping the virtual body model and the drawn silhouettes, the whole BSs were defined
and named, which can support the differences in the identified whole BSs based on the
statistical analyses in this study.
To identify a perfect fit in the sizing system within each BS group ( RQ2), both ASTM
sizing standards for plus sizes for curvy and straight (ASTM D6960/D6960M-16)
(ASTM International, 2016 ) and misses sizes for curvy and straight (ASTM D5585-11)
(ASTM International, 2012 ) were used for five body parts (bust, under bust, waist, top hip,Overweight
and obese
women ’s body

hip). The formula for fit tolerance (measurement plus half of the interval) was used to
determine the size appropriate for each body part ( Simmons et al., 2004 ). The perfect fit was
determined separately for tops and bottoms when three related body measurements (i.e. bust,
under bust and waist for tops, waist, top hip and hip for bottoms) were consistent with the
ASTM sizing standards. Thereafter, values of perfect fit for tops (bust, under bust and waist)
and bottoms (waist, top hip and hip) in each size standard were obtained: For tops and
bottoms, “0”was recorded when there were no size differences among all three parts, which
refers to the perfect fit. Otherwise, if there were size differences in at least one area for tops
and bottoms, “1”was recorded as fit problems. When a female ’s body did not fall within the
range of sizing standard, “2”was coded to indicate “not applicable (NA) ”. Then, for each BS
group, we calculated frequencies and percentages of the values of the perfect fit in each size
standard.
Results
Principal component analysis
Through multiple PCA with 13 measurements, three variables that were highly correlated
were deleted. A total of eight drop values and two raw measurements (buttocks angle, bust
front depth and bust back depth) was found to be useful to categorize the OWOB female
participants ’BSs. As shown in Table 1 , five PCs with eigenvalues greater than 1.0 that
explained 76.3% of the variation in the 10 variables were extracted. The PCs were as follows:
PC1 –Waist to hip silhouette and buttocks prominence; PC2 –Bust prominence; PC3 –Bust to
waist back silhouette; PC4 –Back curvature (outward curvature of upper back and inward
curvature of lower back) and PC5 –Abdomen prominence.
AsTable 2 shows, PC1 had high loadings with three drop values, back arc: hip-top hip and
width: hip-waist, and a value of buttocks angle. PC2 was correlated highly with two drop
values, front arc: bust-waist and front depth: bust-waist. PC3 had a high correlation with two

back arc drop values (bust-waist and bust-under bust). PC4 had high loadings with two
values of back length from neck to waist with/wjthout bumps. PC5 had a high loading with a
drop value of front depth: abdomen-waist. Analysis of the five variables showed that five PCs
with eigenvalues of 1.0 and greater of 10 variables: PC1 523.37%; PC2 516.20%;
PC3513.24%; PC4 512.48% and PC5 511.02%, explained 76.30% of the variations.
The last variable was calculated as a z-score to be used as an independent variable in the
cluster analysis.
Cluster analysis
To determine the optimal number of clusters, a hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted to
test the elbow method. The five PCs selected previously were used for this analysis. Ward ’s
methods were applied to the five PCs to obtain coefficients of an agglomeration schedule.
The coefficients ’gap between 2,668 and 2,669 was much higher than the previous gaps. Thus,
the optimal number of clusters was 5, which was obtained by subtracting 2,667 from 2,672.
A K-mean cluster analysis was performed using the five PC scores to categorize the whole
BS. After testing two to six clusters, the five-cluster model was chosen (cluster 1: n5502,
18.8%, cluster 2: n5571, 21.4%, cluster 3 5348, 13.0%, cluster 4: n5593, 22.2%, cluster 5:
n5658, 24.6). The results for the two-cluster model (cluster 1: n51,345, 49.6%, cluster 2:
n51,347, 50.4%, iteration stopped at 34), three-cluster model (cluster 1: n51,032, 38.6%,

n5565, 21.1%, iteration stopped at 33) were calculated. In the six-cluster model, one cluster
(cluster 1) was represented in less than 1% of the data overall. Therefore, the results verified
that the five-cluster model was inappropriate for the whole BS categorization.
In the five-cluster model, the results of the one-way ANOVA showed the overall Fwas
statistically significant at p< 0.001 for five PC variables that ranged from 241.04 to 518.72
(Table 3 ). A post hoc analysis showed that there were significant differences at the 0.05 level
in the means of all of the five variables ’possible pairwise comparisons, with the exception of
PC4 (Back curvature) between Group 1 and Group 4, which did not differ, and the Z(Abdomen
prominence) between Group 1 and Group 5, which did not differ. The means and standard
deviations of the PCs ’values were ranked a, b, c, d and e according to the magnitude of the
mean value.
For the waist to hip silhouette and buttocks prominence (PC1), Group 1 (G1) had the widest
hips from the front view and most prominent buttocks from the side view (0.84), followed by
Group 5 (G5, 0.26), while Group 4 (G4) had the narrowest hips from the front view and the
flattest buttocks from the side view ( /C00.66). For bust prominence from the side view (PC2), G5
had the most prominent bust (0.75), followed by G2 (0.39), while G2 had the least prominent
bust from the side view ( /C01.06). With respect to the bust-to-waist back silhouette, G5 was the
most sloped and tilted toward the back (0.75) followed by G2 (0.59), while G1 had the
straightest and flattest back ( /C00.85). For the back curvature from neck to waist (PC4), G3 had
the most outward upper back and most inward lower back (1.69), followed by G5 ( /C00.12),
while G1 ( /C00.33) and G4 ( /C00.38) had the flattest back curvature from neck to waist. With
respect to the abdomen prominence ( Z) from the side view, G1 (0.61) and G5 (0.52) had the
most prominent abdomen compared to the waist area, followed by G3 (0.05), while G4 had the
least prominent abdomen ( /C00.90).
Body shape categorization ( RQ1)
Table 4 shows the means and standard deviations of each BS group for the 10 variables.
According to the one-way ANOVA, the overall Fs for all variables ranged from 32.42 to
2026.21 and differed significantly at p< 0.001. A post hoc analysis was also conducted to
identify differences in each variable ’s means among the five BS groups.
As shown in Table 4 , with respect to each BS ’s characteristics, G1 had relatively fewer

bust levels among the five groups. This results in a straight front and back upper body

had the curviest shape in the front lower body silhouette with the widest hip compared to
waist width. Further, G1 had the most prominent abdomen and buttocks in the lower body
silhouette from the side view among the five groups.
Participants in G2 had a larger back arc at the bust level compared to that at the under
bust and waist areas than did the other four groups. Because the bust from the side view does
not appear to be more prominent, with a lower value of the front depth drop between the bust
and waist areas than the waist and abdomen areas, the upper body silhouette overall from the
side view looks like a parallelogram. For the lower body silhouette from the side view, G2 has
a moderate buttocks and prominent abdomen, which results in a moderately curvy shape.
G3 has a similar upper body silhouette from the side view to that of G2, with a more
prominent belly at the waist and abdomen levels than the bust level, while G3 has the curviest
back (the most prominent upper back and the most inward curvature in the waist level). The
lower body silhouette from the side view is referred to as the hip tilt shape because the inward
curve in the lower back area is above the waist line, and is far from 180 degrees of the waist
line compared to the floor that causes it to look different from G2.
G4’s upper body silhouette has an inverted trapezoid shape from the side view, because
the front and back depth at the bust level are larger than those at the waist level from the sideVariables for

view. Although G4 has the flattest buttocks and abdomen among the five groups, the lower
body silhouette has a moderately curvy shape from the side view.
G5 has the most prominent bust and upper back at the bust level compared to the waist
level from the side view, and has an inverted trapezoid shape, as G4 shows. G5 ’s lower body
from the front view has the greatest difference in width between the hip and waist levels, as in
G1. G5 also has the most prominent abdomen in the lower body from the side view compared
to that at the waist level among the five groups. Given that it has the second largest buttocks
angle, the second largest difference in back arc between hip and top hip, and an inward curve
in the waist area that is above the actual waist line, G5 ’s lower body silhouette is referred to as
the hip tilt shape, which may result from posture.
Each group ’s whole BS was classified based on the upper and lower body silhouette from
the side view and lower body silhouette from both the front and side views (see Table 5 ).
Before classifying the whole BS, the front and back upper body silhouettes from the side view
were identified based on the silhouette lines in black and a 3D avatar created using CLO 5.1
software (see Figure 1 ). The silhouette lines were drawn based on points of the body
measurements, such as width measures of bust, waist and hip areas from the front view and
front X and back X on the bust, waist, hip, abdomen and buttocks from the side view. A total
of 23 measurements required were extracted from the data to create a 3D virtual model in
CLO, which included seven height measurements (total, bust, under bust, waist, top hip, hip,
crotch), eight girth measurements (neck base, bust, under bust, waist, top hip, hip, thigh,
upper arm), six length measurements (center front neck to waist, center back neck to waist,
side neck to apex, apex to apex, total crotch length, across back shoulder) and a drop value
(shoulder drop) and width value (back shoulder width). After overlapping the black silhouette
lines with the 3D avatar, we elected to use the avatar to show the five categorized BSs because
the avatars for the five BS groups offered a relatively accurate way to visualize each
group ’s BS.
The population distribution among the BS groups identified were as follows: G1 ( n5502,
18.8%); G2 ( n5571, 21.4%); G3 ( n5348, 13.0%); G4 ( n5593, 22.2%) and G5 ( n5658,
24.6%). The demographic distribution of each BS group was analyzed based on the age
ranges ( Table 6 ). In the 18 –25-year-old and the 26 –35-year-old age range, the majority of the
subjects was categorized in G5 (25.5%; 26.1%) and G4 (22.1%; 23.5%), while G3 (14.0%;
12.1%) had the smallest population. Most women in the 36 –45-year old age range were
classified in G5 (24.6%), followed by G2 (22.4%), while G3 (15.0%) included the fewest

primarily in either G5 (25.9%) or G1 (23.6%). Of the non-Hispanic Caucasians, most were in
G5 (25.5%) and were classified fairly evenly into the other three groups (G1: 20.6%; G4:
20.4%; G2: 19.4%). Like the Mexican Hispanic population, the majority of the non-Mexican

Fit accuracy among five body shapes with ASTM sizing standards ( RQ2)
Standard tables for the body measurements for curvy and straight plus sizes (ASTM D6960/
D6960M-16) ( ASTM International, 2016 ) and for curvy and straight misses sizes (ASTM
D5585-11) ( ASTM International, 2012 ) were used to compare with body measurements for
each of the five BSs categorized (see Table 7 ).
The results showed that women in G1 and G4 would obtain a perfect fit in tops in the plus
size curvy (G1:12.0%, G4:18.4%) and the misses straight (G1: 12.2%, G4: 16.4%) sizing
systems. Less than 19% of women were able to find a perfect fit in all of the three body areas
(i.e. bust, under bust and waist areas) while 42.6 –60.4% of them had fit problems in at least
one body area for tops in the plus curvy and the misses straight. Similarly, women in G2 and
G3 would obtain a perfect fit in tops across the three sizing standards: Plus curvy (G2: 15.8%,
G3: 15.2%), plus straight (G2: 14.2%, G3: 12.9%) and misses straight (G2: 15.9%, G3: 13.5%).
About a half of women in G2 and G3 (47.7 –59.2%) had fit problems at least one area of tops for
plus curvy, plus straight and misses straight sizing. Interestingly, for women in G5, tops in
the misses curvy (15.2%) and straight (11.9%) sizes offered the relatively more perfect fit; and
fit problems at the same time compared to misses curvy (73.1%) and straight (78.9%) sizes.
For bottoms, the plus size curvy sizing system would offer a perfect fit for women in G1
(10.6%), while for women in G2 (11.9%), G3 (14.1%) and G4 (13.8%), a perfect fit would be
obtained in the plus straight sizing system. For other sizing systems, less than 8% of women
in G1-G4 had a perfect fit. Approximately a half of women in G1-G4 (42.8 –58.8%) had fit
problems in at least one area of bottoms in the four sizing systems. Finally, women in G5
would achieve a perfect fit in bottoms (6.4%) in the misses straight sizing system followed by
bottoms (4.9%) in the plus curvy sizing system.
Conclusions and implications
Five whole BSs were categorized among OWOB females in the US: Rectangle-curvy shape;
parallelogram-moderately curvy shape; parallelogram-hip tilt shape; inverted trapezoid-
moderately curvy shape and inverted trapezoid-hip tilt shape. The OWOB females ’BSs were
identified primarily based on their side views, as five PCs explained the characteristics of
their body from the side silhouette, although the first PC was related in part to the lower bodyfrom the front view. The results implied that OWOB females ’whole BS differed significantly
from the side views.
The whole BS was classified by combining the silhouette for the side upper and lower
body. There were three different silhouettes for the side upper body: Rectangle; parallelogram
and inverted trapezoid. Only one group was identified with the rectangle silhouette, where
females have similarly prominent bust and upper abdomen areas and no curvature in the
back upper body observed from the side. Females with more prominent upper abdomens
compared to their bust areas and curvature in the upper back were classified as having a
parallelogram shape in their side upper body silhouette. If females had a more prominent bust
than their upper abdomen areas, with curvature in their upper back, their side upper body
silhouette was categorized into the inverted trapezoid shape. There were two BS groups for
each parallelogram and inverted trapezoid shape. However, the degree of curvature differed
in each: For the parallelogram shape, those in G2 showed a more moderate curvature in their
upper back than did those in G3, while for the inverted trapezoid shape, those in G4 had less
curvature in their upper back than did those in G5.
With respect to the lower body silhouette, curvy, moderately curvy and hip-tilt shapes
were identified among OWOB females. These results were consistent in part with those inJFMM

Song and Ashdown ’s (2011) study, in which females ’lower bodies had curvy and hip-tilt
shapes. Interestingly, no straight shape was identified, as their study on BS categorization
focused on the general female population. A new lower BS category for the OWOB females
was the moderately curvy shape. A moderately curvy and hip-tilt shape tended to relate to the
side back upper body silhouette: If someone has curvature in her upper back, she is likely to
have a hip-tilt shape in her lower body; if she has moderate curvature, her lower body
silhouette will have a moderately curvy shape. These results were supported by a previous
study on obesity and posture that found that obesity caused increased thoracic kyphosis and
hyperlordosis ( Fabris De Souza et al. , 2005 ). This difference may be because this study
focused specifically on BMI groups of OWOB females.
This study is the first attempt to analyze perfect fit and fit problems for tops and bottoms
by comparing the ASTM sizing charts with body measurements in newly identified BS
groups. For G1, tops in straight missy size and in plus size for curvy, and bottoms in plus size
for curvy were better than other sizing categories; for G2, tops in plus size for curvy, tops in
misses and plus size for straight and bottoms in plus size for straight fit better than in other
sizing systems; for G3 and G4, tops in plus size for curvy and in misses size for straight, and
bottoms in plus size for straight fit better than in other sizing systems; for G5, tops in misses
size for curvy and straight fit better than in other sizing systems. This sizing system provided
the greatest number of perfect fits for bottoms in misses size for straight and fit problems.
According to the results, less than four-fifths or more of OWOB female adults in the US would
find it difficult to obtain a perfect fit for both tops and bottoms in the current ASTM sizing
systems for both misses and plus sizes. This study has implications for apparel product
developers and designers in the US, in that the sizing system for OWOB female adults needs
to be revised according to the whole BS categories.
Identifying whole BSs among OWOB women in the US contributes significantly because
it will help apparel companies that target the markets of larger women develop a new sizing
system. Understanding larger women ’s BSs and related anthropometric characteristics will
provide insights into the way the current ASTM sizing system needs to be updated. For
example, OWOB women are likely to have fit problems in tops because of their looser fit in the
bust areas if they choose tops based on their waist sizes. Further, they are likely to have fit
problems in bottoms (i.e. looser fit in their hip areas) if they choose sizes based on their waist
size. These results implied that apparel companies that target larger women in the US should
consider modifying the waist sizes when they draft patterns that are larger than the current
standardized sizing system. Improving the sizing system for larger female consumers willBody shape group

benefit them because they may experience less social discrimination and feel more included.
Further, by reducing OWOB female consumers ’perceived fit and size problems, apparel
companies may achieve social responsibility and more economic benefits with fewer returns
and exchanges ( Faust and Carrier, 2010 ). In addition, if OWOB female consumers are better
served, they will become loyal to a certain apparel brand that provides better fit and size,
which in turn increases the company ’s revenues.
Furthermore, this study contributes to body-related literature by filling gaps in missing
whole BS categories among OWOB females. This study has a methodological implication as
well, in that the PCA and cluster analysis Song and Ashdown (2011) andPark and Park (2013)
suggested were useful methods to categorize the whole BS from the front and side views

This study used the SizeUSA data to categorize BSs in the OWOB female population in the
US Future studies to confirm the BSs suggested and compare them using different datasets
collected by different companies (e.g. SizeNA) may be conducted. Further research can also be
conducted using the same methods to categorize BSs for OWOB men in the US. Lastly,
although we included body measurements for both upper and lower bodies, but thigh girth
was excluded due to the high correlation with other body measurements. In future studies,
categorizing lower BSs among OWOB women may include thigh girth so that it can provide
practical insights to improve the sizing system for bottoms.
