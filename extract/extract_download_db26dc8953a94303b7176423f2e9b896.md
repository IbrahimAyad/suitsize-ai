MEASURING 
GUIDE

 
Complete Measurement Guide  
(with extra guidance in red!) 
 
         
How to use this guide:  
a) You need:  
- A fabric tape measure (not a construction tape measure!)  
- A pen or pencil to mark down measurements.  
- Time. Usually about 10 – 20 minutes is enough.  
 
b) It would help if..  
- You had assistance from a friend when measuring  
- You wore a good fitting dress -shirt and slacks. If you do not have these items, fine, just  
  wear anything that fits your form (t -shirt and boxers included). Do not wear jeans as the y    
  seriously alter measurements, and also make sure to empty your pockets!  
c) When measuring..  
       - Hold the measuring tape flat against the body. It should beheld snug enough so not to  
         droop, but never so tight as to feel restrictive.  
       - Take your measurements to the nearest quarter (.25) inch.  
       - Do not add wiggle room to your measurements. We will adjust the fit based off of your  
         selected preferences and build. All measurements are “skin measurements”.  
d) All that is left to do is to..  
      - Read the instructions per measurement, understand what it is asking of you and follow.  
      - Look to the photos as guidance.  
      - Write down your measurements on the last page and forward it to us on  [ contact@bebetailor.com  ]. 
      - If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask.  
 
 
 
 
 

 
1. Neck          
 
● Measure around your neck at the height where your  
    collar, if buttoned, would be.  
 
● This measurement should be taken along the lower  
    section of the neck, below your Adam’s apple and above  
    your sternal notch.  
 
● The tape should be comfortably touching the skin, with  
    enough room so that you do not feel restricted.  
 
● My neck is _._ centimeters.  
 
      When we take this measurement, based off your height/weight/fit preference, we add a percentage to ensure your  
      shirt collar fits comfortably after multiple washings during which it will shrink slightly.  
 
 
2. Full chest  
 
● Measure around the chest and body at its fullest part  
   (typically right under the armpits and shoulder  
   blades, right across the nipples).  
 
● Hold the tape against the body tight enough so that  
    it does not slip down, but not so tight that it re stricts  
    breathing. It should be “snug”.  
 
 
● Make sure the tape is horizontal and the person's  
    arms are by their side; then take a normal breath and  
    measure.  
 
● Do not puff out your chest.  
 
● Double check this measurement.  
 
● My full chest  is _._ centimeters.  
 
 
      This measurement should be at the point your chest is its largest – which should be where we have  
      specified. If you have an extremely large or muscular chest, remember that you will not be flexing in this  
      suit, so take the measurement in a relaxed, normal state.  

 
3. Full shoulder width  
 
● Measure from the end of the right shoulder  
    to the end of the left shoulder.  
 
 
● We define the “end of the shoulder” as  
     where the horizontal plane of the shoulder  
     intersects the vertical plane of the arm (see  
     illustration).  
 
● Double check the measurement.  
 
● My full shoulder width is _._ centimeters.  
 
 
     This is the measurement we see taken wrong most often, so be very careful. To check this me asurement,  
     take your best fitting jacket and measure your shoulders while wearing it. Now look at both - your jacket  
     measurement should be the same to a ½ inch larger. If it’s not, ask yourself: is your current jacket too large  
     or too sma ll? From this you can now more accurately determine your shoulder size. If you need help, please  
     ask us for further clarification!  
 
 
 
4. Right &  left sleeves  
 
       ● Measure from the end of the right shoulder to the “pinch”  
           of the hand.  
       ● The “pinch” of the hand is found where the base of the thumb  
           and the base of the index finger intersect (approximately  
           2.5 centimeters above the index finger knuckle).  
       ● My right sleeve is _._ centimeters.  
       ● Repeat the same process for the left hand.  
       ● My left sleeve is _._ centimeters.  
 
        Place a safe ty pin where you determined the shoulder points to be  
        as this will come useful later for other measurements.  
 
 

 
5. Biceps  
 
● Keep you r arms by your side and measure around  
     the fullest part of the bicep.  
 
● You need only measure one side.  
 
● My biceps are _._ centimeters.  
 
 
       No need to flex, unless you are a body builder – but  
       we’ll  be able to see that from your other  
       measurements and will make sure you have plenty of  
       room in the arm.  
 
 
6. Wrist s 
  
● Measure around the fullest part of the wrist.  
 
● You need only measure one side.  
 
● My wrist s are _._ centimeters.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
7. Waist/stomach  
 
● Measure around the fullest part of the waist/stomach  
    or right below your bottom ribs, whichever is greater.  
 
       ● My jacket waist is _._ centimeters.  
 
       If you are a large man, make sure to measure around the  
       widest point her e. Also, be prepared for us to contact you  
       to collect a few additional measurements to ensure we  
       build your clothing correctly.  
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
8. Hips/seat  
 
● Measure around the fullest part of your hips and buttocks.  
 
       ● My hips/seat  is _._ centimeters.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9. Front jacket length  
 
       ● Keep your arms straight at your side, and measure  
           straight down the front from the base of the neck  
           (on either side) to the point of your thumb knuckle.  
 
● My front jacket length is _._ centimeters.  
 
      This measurement helps us determine your jacket length,  
      but is not the only factor we consider. We also look at your  
      height, full back length, the length of jacket you are used to,  
      and the type of jacket we are building for you.  
 
 
 

 
    10. Front chest width  
 
    ● With the person's arms by their side, measure across  
          the front of the chest.  
 
    ● Start at the front of the right armpit, continue measuring  
         across the nipples, and then stop at the front of the left  
         armpit. Do not measure under the arms.  
 
     ● This is the front part of the full chest measurement we  
         took in step 2.  
 
     ● My front chest width  is _._ centimeters.  
 
     This is not half the chest measurement  – it’s from the point  
     where your armpit starts – straight across the chest – to the  
     exact spot on the other side. You can take this measurement  
     facing the person (unlike the picture).  
 
 
 
 
   11. Back width  
 
     ● With the person's arms by their side, measure across  
          the back.  
 
     ● Start at the back of the right armpit, continue measuring     
         across the shoulder blade s, and then stop at the back of  
         the left ar mpit. Do not measure under the arms.  
 
     ● This is the back part of the full chest measurement we  
         took in step 2.  
 
     ● My back width is _._ centimeters.  
 
     Again , this is not half the chest measurement – it’s from  
     the point where your armpit starts – straight across the  
     back of the chest – to the exact spot on the other side.  
 
 
 

   12. Half shoulder width (right & left)   
 
     ● Measure from the end of the right shoulder to the base of  
         the right side of the neck.  
 
     ● We define the “side of the neck” as the point at which the  
         vertical plane of the neck intersects the horizontal plane of  
         the shoulder.  
 
     ● My half shoulder width (right) is _._ centimeters.  
 
     ● Repeat the same process for the left side.  
 
     ● My half shoulder width (left) is _._ centimeters.  
 
     Keep the safety pin attached from measurements 4 & 5 at  
     the shoulder points, this will ensure it aligns perfectly with  
     the other measurements.  
 
 
 
 
   13. Full back length   
 
     ● Measure from the base of the back of the neck to the floor.  
 
     ● We define the “base of the back of the neck” as the point at  
         which the 7th cervical bone is located. To easily find this point,  
         have the person being measured tilt his head forward so that  
         the “knobby” bone at the base of the neck becomes obvious.  
         Once located, you can have the person stand straight  again and  
         then measure.  
 
     ● No shoes please!  
      
     ● Double check this measurement.  
 
     ● My full back length  is _._ centimeters.  
 
     This measurement helps us determine your jacket length, but is not  
     the only factor we consider. We also look at your height, jacket  
     length measurement, the length of your current coat, and the type  
     of jacket we are building for you.  
 
 
 

 
 
 
   14. Half back length   
 
     ● Measure from the base of the back of the neck to the top of the  
         pants waistband area.  
 
     ● My half back length is _._ centimeters.  
 
     No jeans here – they would give us a measurement that is too long!  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   15. Trouser waist   
 
     ● Measure around your waist at the level where you would  
         normally wear your pant’s belt.  
 
     ● With the tape measure snug around your waist, relax, and take  
         the measurement.  
 
     ● Don't be alarmed if this measurement seems larger than expected;  
         off-the-rack pants are normally labeled as being smaller than what  
         they really are.  
 
     ● My trouser waist is _._ centimeters.  
 
     It’s the truth – your 36 in ch waist jeans are more like 39 inches.  
     Why they do this, we do not know!  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
   16. Trouser’s outseam   
 
     ● Measure from the top of your pant’s waistband to the floor  
         along the outside of your leg.  
 
     ● Make sure the tape is tight, that you are standing straight, and  
         then measure. No shoes please!  
 
     ● Double check this measurement.  
 
     ● My trouser’s outseam is _._ centimeters.  
 
     We will build your trousers to this exact measu rement. If you are  
     interested in higher fitting trousers such as those made for  
     braces/suspenders, or like to have a shorter or longer leg fit,  
     please let us know in the notes section.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   17. Trouser’s inseam   
 
   ● Measure from  the lowest part of your crotch area to the floor.   
 
   ● Make sure the tape is tight along the inside of your leg, that you  
        are standing straight, and then measure. No shoes please!   
 
     ● My trouser’s inseam  is _._ centimeters.  
 
     How  high should you measure? Only as high as you’re comfortable with.  
     Don’t worry, this measurement is only a small part of three measurements  
     we use to determine this final length.  
 
 
 
 
 

   
   18. Crotch   
 
     ● Measure from the front top of the pant's waistband to the back top of the pant's waistband.  
 
     ● Make sure not to take this measurement too tight.  
 
     ● My crotch measurement  is _._ centimeters.  
 
     The key here is to wear a comfortable pair of slacks – no jeans!  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
 
 
 
    
 
 
   19. Thigh   
 
   ● Measure around your thigh at its widest point.  
 
     ● You need measure only one side.  
 
     ● My thighs are _._ centimeters.  
 
     We are looking for the widest section of your thigh here – this     
     may be lower or higher than pictured.  
 
 
 
 

    
 
 
   20. Knee   
 
     ● Measure around your knee at its widest point.  
 
     ● You need only measure one side.  
 
     ● My knees are _._ centimeters.  
 
     The key here is to wear a comfortable pair of slacks – no jeans!  
 
 
   
 
 
 
   21. Right full sleeve   
  
     ● Measure from the base of the right side of the neck to the  
         pinch of the right hand.  
 
     ● This is a “check” measurement. This measurement should  
         be within a half -inch of measurements 4 and 13 combined.  
         If not, recheck those two measurements.  
 
     ● My right full sleeve  is _._ centimeters.  
 
 
   22. Left full sleeve   
 
     ● Measure from the base of the right side of the neck to the  
         pinch of the left hand.  
 
     ● This is a “check” measurement. This measurement should  
         be within a half -inch of measurements 5 and 14 combined.  
         If not, recheck those two measurements.  
 
     ● My left full sleeve  is _._ centimeters.  
 
And that’s it! Those are all the measurements you have to take. You can and should double check each  
       measurement and fill them in on the next page as accurately as possible.
