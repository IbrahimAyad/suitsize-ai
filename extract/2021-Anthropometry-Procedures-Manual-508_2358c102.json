Underweight may occur due to a variety of factors, such as poor nutrition and eating habits, substance abuse, chronic illness, medication therapy, surgical procedures, and other health problems.  \n\nNHANES is the only health examination study that produces national estimates for the U.S. population—all ages and all sizes. NCHS continues to publish reports based on the NHANES anthropometry data. The most recent national reference data for children and adults based on NHANES 2015-2018 are available through the CDC website at the following link:  \n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_03/sr03-046-508.pdf. The NHANES body measures examination data files are also publicly available and may be downloaded from the NHANES website: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/. The Questionnaires, Datasets, and Related Documentation page lists all the survey cycles from the most recent to most historic. The Procedure Manuals page for each survey cycle offers access to the NHANES anthropometric procedures training manuals used for each NHANES. The NHANES III Anthropometric Procedures video is also available through the CDC website at the following link:  \n\nhttps://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/Nhanes3/AnthropometricVideos.aspx. Lastly, hyperlinks for data, questionnaires, and manuals for each NHANES survey are also provided on the NHANES website.  \n\n1.4 Overview of NHANES Anthropometry Examination  \n\nThe NHANES anthropometry or body measures examination is conducted in trailer 1 of the mobile examination center (MEC). All NHANES study participants or sample persons (SPs) are eligible for the anthropometry examination component. Specific measurements are completed dependent on the age of the participant. The complete set of measurements includes weight, height, upper leg and arm lengths, and waist, arm, and hip circumferences. The anthropometry examination protocol and procedures are described in Chapter 3, Examination Protocol. Two health technologists (one is an examiner and another is a recorder) work as a team to collect the anthropometry data. Examination results are saved to the study database using the Integrated Survey Information System (ISIS) anthropometry computer application. Funding for the anthropometry examination component is provided solely by NCHS.  \n\n1.5 Role of Anthropometric Examiner and Recorder  \n\nThe anthropometry component is staffed by trained health technologists. The NHANES health technologists may serve as examiners or recorders for this component. When two health technologists are assigned by the MEC coordinator to the anthropometry room, the technologist assigned as the examiner should complete the entire examination.  \n\nThe examiner will position the participant, take all measurements, and tell the recorder the measurement values to record as described in Chapter 3, Examination Protocol. The recorder will enter the examination results in the ISIS anthropometry application. The ISIS module is programmed to present the anthropometry data entry screens in the correct sequence based on the age of the participant. The ISIS interface is also preprogrammed with age- and gender-specific edit ranges for each measurement, based on previous NHANES data. This feature is designed to reduce data entry errors that may result from either incorrect measurement or data entry errors. Chapter 4 describes the quality control features of the ISIS anthropometry application. If a recorded value falls outside the preprogrammed edit range, the ISIS system will alert the recorder that the recorded value is unusual. The recorder should always ask the examiner to verify the measurement value before proceeding to the next measurement. If a measurement or recording error was made, the recorder will enter the correct value; if the original value is correct, the value is retained. Since NHANES includes participants of all shapes, sizes, and body builds, some unusual values are legitimate; however, measurement and recording errors do occasionally occur. Therefore, teamwork between the examiner and recorder is essential in order to measure and record accurate data.  \n\nAnother important duty of the recorder is to help the examiner position the participants during their examination. In this role the recorder also alerts the examiner if the respondent needs to be repositioned. For example, when the waist circumference is determined, the recorder checks that the tape measure lies parallel to the floor and snug but without compressing the skin. Also, the recorder participates in taking recumbent length measurements on infants and young children. Assistance is needed because several body sites must be aligned to obtain an accurate measurement. Lastly, the recorder marks body sites that are measured by the examiner and hands equipment and supplies to the examiner when needed.  \n\nBarlow, S.E. and the Expert Committee.

The word “anthropometry” is derived from the Greek word “anthropo” meaning “human” and the Greek word “metron” meaning “measure.” The field of anthropometry encompasses a variety of human body measurements. Weight, stature (standing height), recumbent length, skinfold thicknesses, circumferences (head, waist, limb), limb lengths, and breadths (shoulder, wrist) are examples of anthropometric measures.  \n\nSeveral indexes and ratios can be derived from anthropometric measurements. Perhaps the most well-known indicator of body fat is the body mass index or “BMI.” BMI values are calculated for National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) participants using measured height and weight values as follows: weight (kilograms)/height squared (meters). The BMI is used to assess weight status in children and adolescents as well as adults. For children and adolescents, cutoff criteria are based on the gender-specific BMI-for-age growth charts: underweight (BMI values $<$ 5th percentile); healthy weight (BMI values 5th-84th percentiles); overweight (BMI values 85th-94th percentiles); and obesity (BMI values ≥ 95th percentile) (Barlow, 2007). For adults, cutoff criteria are fixed: underweight (BMI values $<18.5)$ ; normal weight (BMI values 18.5-24.9); overweight (BMI values 25.0-29.9); obese—Class I (BMI values 30.0-34.9); obese—Class II (BMI values 35.0-39.9); and extremely obese—Class III (BMI values $\\ge40.0$ ) (National Institutes of Health, 1998). The NHANES BMI results are used to track weight trends in the U.S. population. The National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and many other research groups have reported on the health risks associated with overweight and obesity using NHANES interview and health examination data.  \n\n1.2 Purpose of Anthropometrics  \n\nThe purpose of the NHANES anthropometry component is to collect high-quality body measurement data using standardized examination procedures and calibrated equipment. Accurate data are fundamental to the evaluation of anthropometric trends over time. It is crucial for researchers to know that the differences evident between NHANES surveys reflect true differences in the NHANES body measurement values rather than technologist and protocol variability and/or measurement error. In order to ensure the collection of high-quality data, NHANES staff are trained to follow standardized examination protocols, to calibrate equipment according to a prescribed schedule and method, and to measure and record the survey data with precision. Additionally, retraining sessions, gold standard examinations performed by expert examiners and field observations, are conducted on a regular basis to reinforce the importance of measurement precision and standardized data collection methodology.  \n\n1.3 Importance of Anthropometric Data  \n\nAnthropometry is a key component of nutrition status assessment in children and adults. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) has included the anthropometry data collection in its examination surveys since 1960. The NHANES anthropometry data have been used to track growth and weight trends in the U.S. population for more than 40 years (Flegal et al., 2002; Flegal et al., 2010; Ogden et al., 2002; Ogden et al., 2016). The anthropometric data for infants and children reflect general health status and dietary adequacy and are used to track trends in growth and development over time. The CDC has used NHANES data to produce national reference standards or “growth charts.” These CDC growth charts are used extensively by pediatricians and researchers in the U.S. and abroad (Kuczmarski et al., 2002). A description of the history and statistical methodology that was used to develop the latest growth charts can be found at the CDC website: http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/. The highly publicized NHANES data trends showing increases in overweight and obesity among U.S. children and adolescents underscore the importance of NHANES to provide continuous health data (Ogden et al., 2002). Although previous data show that the overall rates of obesity have plateaued or even declined among children 2-5 years of age (Ogden et al., 2016), the most recent analyses of NHANES data indicate that the prevalence of obesity among adults has moved further away from the Healthy People 2020 goal of 30.5 percent (Hales et al., 2020; Ogden et al., 2020). Obesity remains a major public health problem. It is important to continue to track the prevalence of obesity among U.S. adults and children.  \n\nThe NHANES anthropometric data are used to evaluate health and dietary status, disease risk, and body composition changes that occur over the adult lifespan. Researchers in diverse health disciplines including cardiovascular health, gerontology, nutrition, and occupational health use anthropometric data to examine health status and health care utilization trends in U.S. adults.  \n\nCurrent U.S. demographic trends project significant growth among race/ethnic subgroups and adults 75 years and older. These trends are reflected in the NHANES sample, which includes a large proportion of adults 60 years and older, African Americans, and Hispanics. Racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to be medically underserved compared to non-Hispanic Whites in terms of having a regular source of health care, health insurance, and access to preventive health services. Valuable health information on population groups that might not be reflected in other health reporting systems is routinely collected in surveys sponsored by the National Center for Health Statistics.  \n\nWith respect to the “graying” U.S. population, the “baby boomer” generation has reached or is approaching retirement age. What will their quality of life be like during their “golden years?” How much health care will older persons need to maintain their health? What types of health conditions will be more prevalent among older Americans? Functional status and general well-being are inevitably linked to weight status. An analysis of the NHANES 1999-2002 data using BMI criteria indicated that overweight and obese individuals were more likely to report fair or poor health (rather than good or excellent health), activity limitations, and more health provider visits per year compared to normal weight adults (McDowell et al., 2006). More recent analysis of the NHANES 2013-2016 data indicated that prevalence of obesity and severity of obesity was greater among adults living in a nonmetropolitan statistical area compared with adults living in large metropolitan statistical areas (Hales, 2018).  \n\nThe NHANES circumference measures assess subcutaneous and visceral fat tissue. Reports based on NHANES data showed increasing mid-arm circumference measurements in children and adults (Ostchega et al., 2005; Ostchega et al., 2006). These data have been used to formulate guidelines for health practitioners regarding the selection of blood pressure cuff sizes for children and adults. In addition, the NHANES waist circumference data are widely used to assess cardiovascular disease risk. Specifically, individuals who have large deposits of abdominal fat tissue are at increased risk for hypertension, adult-onset diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, gallstones, arthritis, and some forms of cancer. The NHANES sagittal abdominal diameter measures provide the first national population reference data across various demographic groups (Fryar et al., 2016). Sagittal abdominal diameter was associated with dysglycemia independently of waist circumference or BMI (Kahn et al., 2014).\n\n2021 Anthropometry Procedures Manual  \n\nMay 2021  \n\nChapters  \n\nOverview of Anthropometry . 1-1  \n\n1.1 Background of Anthropometric Measurements. .. 1-1   \n1.2 Purpose of Anthropometrics ... 1-1   \n1.3 Importance of Anthropometric Data .... 1-2   \n1.4 Overview of NHANES Anthropometry Examination ... 1-4   \n1.5 Role of Anthropometric Examiner and Recorder .. 1-5  \n\nReferences ... 1-6  \n\n2 Equipmen 2-1  \n\n2.1 Description of the Body Measurement Room in the MEC 2-1   \n2.2 Equipment and Supplies ... 2-1   \n2.2.1 Equipment .. 2-1   \n2.2.2 Supplies .... 2-5   \n2.3 Equipment Care and Maintenance .. 2-8   \n2.4 Equipment Malfunctions . 2-9   \n2.5 Setup Procedures...... 2-10   \n2.5.1 Calibration Weights . 2-10   \n2.5.2 Digital Weight Scale 2-10   \n2.5.3 Portable Scale . 2-10   \n2.5.4 Sitting Box ........ 2-11   \n2.5.5 Stadiometer ......... 2-11   \n2.5.6 Infantometer ......... 2-11   \n2.5.7 Knee Caliper .......... 2-11   \n2.5.8 Measurement Tapes and Ruler . 2-12   \n2.5.9 Supplies ..... 2-12  \n\n2.6 Teardown Procedures 2-12  \n\n2.6.1 Calibration Weights . 2-12   \n2.6.2 Digital Weight Scale 2-13   \n2.6.3 Portable Scale . 2-13   \n2.6.4 Sitting Box ....... 2-13   \n2.6.5 Stadiometer ......... 2-13   \n2.6.6 Infantometer ........ 2-13   \n2.6.7 Knee Caliper ..... 2-14  \n\nChapters  \n\n2.6.8 Measurement Tapes and Ruler . 2-14   \n2.6.9 Supplies .... 2-14  \n\n3 Examination Protocol . 3-1  \n\n3.1 Eligibility Criteria . 3-1   \n3.2 Pre-Examination Procedures . 3-1   \n3.3 General Guidelines for Measuring and Recording. ..... 3-2   \n3.4 Examination Procedures 3-3   \n3.4.1 Recumbent Length 3-3   \n3.4.2 Head Circumference 3-5   \n3.4.3 Standing Height 3-6   \n3.4.4 Weight . 3-9   \n3.4.5 Upper Leg Length 3-10   \n3.4.6 Upper Arm Length 3-13   \n3.4.7 Arm Circumference ... 3-17   \n3.4.8 Abdominal (Waist) Circumference 3-19   \n3.4.9 Hip (Buttocks) Circumference ... 3-21  \n\n3.5 Special Considerations. . 3-22  \n\n3.5.1 SPs in Street Clothes 3-22   \n3.5.2 Children .. 3-22   \n3.5.3 SPs in Wheelchairs.. 3-23   \n3.5.4 Amputees .... 3-23   \n3.5.5 Comprehension or Language Difficulties . 3-24  \n\n3.6 Post-Examination Procedures. 3-25  \n\n4 ISIS Data Entry 4-1  \n\n4.1 General Screen Information . 4-1   \n4.2 Stature Screen ... 4-3   \n4.2.1 Height Correction .. 4-6   \n4.2.2 Stature Comments ... 4-7  \n\nChapters  \n\n4.3 Weight Screen . 4-8   \n4.3.1 Weight Comments ...... 4-10   \n4.3.2 Tare and Reset .. 4-11   \n4.4 Sitting Measures Screen ... 4-11   \n4.5 Upper Arm Length Screen . 4-12   \n4.6 Circumference Measures Screen ... 4-13   \n4.7 SP Information Screen .... 4-15   \n4.8 Amputations Screen. ....... 4-16   \n4.9 Anthropometry Component Status Screen .. 4-18  \n\n5 Quality Control . 5-1  \n\n5.1 Introduction to Quality Control for Anthropometry ... 5-1   \n5.2 Equipment Calibrations . 5-1   \n5.2.1 Digital Weight Scale .......... 5-4   \n5.2.2 Portable Scales..... 5-8   \n5.2.3 Stadiometer ......... 5-9   \n5.2.4 Infantometer .... 5-10   \n5.2.5 Equipment Swap ..... 5-11   \n5.3 ISIS Examination Screens.. 5-12   \n5.4 Observations, Replication, and Review . 5-13  \n\nAppendixes  \n\nA Body Measures Recording Form ..

Remove the bungee cord and designated soft padding from the computer monitor and store this in the anthropometry storage container.   \nEnsure that a small trash can is available in the room.  \n\n2.6 Teardown Procedures  \n\nAt the end of the stand, follow the procedures described below to pack up the anthropometry equipment for travel to the next stand. The anthropometry storage container will need to be retrieved from the MEC belly compartment and brought to the exam room.  \n\n2.6.1 Calibration Weights  \n\nUse the weights to calibrate the digital weight scale (see Chapter 5, Quality Control, Section 5.2, Equipment Calibrations).   \nPlace the unfinished bumper board at the front of the weight tray and replace the bolt to secure the weight tray in place for travel.  \n\n2.6.2 Digital Weight Scale  \n\nCalibrate the scale using the calibration weights (see Chapter 5, Quality Control, Section 5.2, Equipment Calibrations).  \n\nPlace the cover on the scale.  \n\n2.6.3 Portable Scale  \n\nDisconnect the batteries.  \n\nLeave the scales in the cabinet drawers.  \n\n2.6.4 Sitting Box  \n\nSlide the sitting box against the corner wall where the mirrors are located.  \n\nNote: The facility and equipment specialist will remove and store the mirror from the exit door wall.  \n\nRemove a bungee cord from the anthropometry storage container and place the strap around two legs of the box. Attach the ends of the strap to the designated wall hooks.  \n\nLower the folding seat located beside the sitting box.  \n\n2.6.5 Stadiometer  \n\nRemove the CR123 battery from the digital measurement device. Check that the screws at the top of the measurement column are secured. If necessary, tighten the screws using the Phillips head screwdriver. Loosely bungee cord the stadiometer to the wall hooks with the strap under the acrylic mount. In this way the stadiometer is secure without stressing the mounts.  \n\n2.6.6 Infantometer  \n\nRemove a strap and padding from the anthropometry storage container.   \nRemove the CR123 battery from the digital measurement device of the infantometer.   \nSlide the foot piece to the right end of the measurement column. Place a bungee cord around the metal base of the foot piece and attach the ends of the strap to the hooks on the headboard.   \nWrap the barcode wand in the padding and insert this between the foot piece and the headboard.  \n\n2.6.7 Knee Caliper  \n\nPlace the knee caliper in the cabinet drawers.  \n\n2.6.8 Measurement Tapes and Ruler  \n\nPlace the plastic insertion tape, steel measuring tape, and height adjustment ruler in the cabinet drawers.  \n\n2.6.9 Supplies  \n\nPlace the following supplies in the cabinet drawers: cosmetic pencils, drop dispenser filled with baby oil, gauze pads, masking tape, Chux pads, blunt-edge scissors, and alcohol wipes.   \nTo avoid spillage during travel, ensure that the large refill bottle of baby oil is upright and in a plastic bag in the cabinet drawer.   \nEnsure that the following additional supplies remain stored in the cabinet drawers: cotton cloth, bleach disinfectant wipes, scrub brush, sewing machine oil, hex key set, and screwdrivers.   \nStrap the computer keyboard, mouse, and wand to the padded monitor using a bungee cord. Mice and wands can also be tucked into the cozy pockets. Make sure the cord is tight enough around the monitor to hold the hardware in place without stressing it. Enclose the computer monitor in the designated soft padding, and strap a bungee cord loosely around this to hold it in place without stressing the hardware.   \nRemove the wooden brace from the anthropometry storage container and insert it in the cabinet drawer handles.   \nDiscard any trash in the room.  \n\n3.1 Eligibility Criteria  \n\nAll NHANES survey participants (SPs) are eligible for the anthropometry or body measurement component in the mobile examination center (MEC). The anthropometry protocol requires specific measurements depending on the age of the SP. Table 3-1 lists the required measurements by age category.  \n\nTable 3-1.

The recorder will confirm that all supplies needed for the exam are available and accessible: cosmetic pencil, gauze pads, baby oil, masking tape strips, scissors, steel measuring tape, head circumference tape, and absorbent Chux pads.  \n\nWhen the SP enters the room, introduce yourself and the recorder and close the exam room curtain. The examiner or recorder will open the anthropometry component in the Integrated Survey Information System (ISIS), log the SP into ISIS, and direct the SP to the stadiometer. The anthropometry component requires no formal or standard script. However, the examiner will provide a brief introduction to the examination, such as:  \n\n“In this room we will take a number of body measurements such as height and weight. We will also measure the length of your arm and leg, and take some circumference measurements.”  \n\nImportant: Prior to initiating the first measurement ask the SP to remove any items from his or her pockets. Set these and other belongings on the infantometer.  \n\n3.3 General Guidelines for Measuring and Recording  \n\nFollow the guidelines below when taking anthropometric measurements and subsequently recording the data into ISIS:  \n\nAlways Tell the SP What you are Going to Do Before you Do It. Explain what you are doing and why, such as when locating the leg tendon in the groin area to measure the upper leg length; or before adjusting the pants down to measure the waist   \ncircumference. Do not comment about the SP’s body in any way. Maintain   \nprofessionalism at all times.   \nMeasure the Right Side of the Body. If the SP has a physical disability or abnormality on the right side, the examiner should still attempt to measure the right side. Only take measurements on the left side when the SP has a cast, prosthesis, or amputation on the appropriate right limb; or for some other reason the measurement cannot be taken accurately on the right side. If a measurements is obtained on the left side, submit an Unusual Field Occurrence (UFO) as documentation (refer to the UFO Utility Manual and Equipment Tracking System User Guide for details).   \nTurn the SP in the Direction needed for a Given Measure. This promotes   \nefficiency during the examination by saving time and avoiding unnecessary movement on the part of the examiner. In other words, do not move yourself around the SP. Position the Zero End of the Measuring Tape Below the Measurement Value. With respect to circumference measures, do not take any measurement readings with the zero end of the tape placed above the section of the tape with the result.   \nAvoid Parallax when Taking Measurement Readings. Parallax describes the phenomenon where an observer reads a different value on a measuring device depending on the angle from which it is viewed. Parallax is a common cause of data error especially for measurements obtained using the measurement tape. The examiner should read the measurement with his or her line of sight directly in front of the value rather than at an angle or from even slightly off to the side.   \nRecord all Measurements to the Nearest Tenth of a Centimeter $(0.1\\,\\mathbf{Cm})$ . For quality control purposes, the computer will read each number aloud immediately following data entry. ISIS will also alert the recorder to any values that are outside a predetermined limit. This warning serves as an alert for possible data entry and measurement errors. Always verify the result before advancing to the next measure.\n\nScrewdrivers:Two screwdrivers——a flat and a Phillips head——are used to open the digital measurement device of the stadiometer and infantometer when changing the batteries. The screwdrivers are also used to adjust screws on the measurement column and digital measurement device of the stadiometer and infantometer. Both screwdrivers are stored in the cabinet drawers.Sewing machine oil:A 4-oz bottle of all-purpose, sewing machine oil is supplied in each MEC. The oil is used to lubricate the aluminum track of the stadiometer and infantometer when sliding the head/foot piece becomes difficult.Scrub brush:A black hand brush is kept on each MEC for cleaning heavily soiled areas asneeded.Weight tray bolt:A bolt is used to secure the weight tray in place during travel between stands. During a stand, the bolt is taped to the inside of the exam room cabinet for easy access. The bolts may vary by MEC.  \n\nExhibits 2-11 and 2-12 show photos of the anthropometry supplies.  \n\nExhibit 2-11.  Anthropometry supplies (1)  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n2.3 Equipment Care and Maintenance  \n\nFollow the procedures below to ensure that the anthropometry equipment functions properly and remains hygienic throughout the stand.  \n\nStart of Stand and Daily  \n\nClean the surface of the knee calipers and tape measures with disinfectant wipes. Clean the white area of the infantometer and sitting box with bleach disinfectant wipes. Use paper towels or the scrub brush if necessary.   \nNote: The Formula 409 cleaner that is generally supplied on each MEC can be used to remove dirt, but it is not suitable for use as a disinfectant.   \nClean the acrylic area of the head/foot piece of the stadiometer and infantometer with alcohol wipes.   \nClean the digital measurement device of the stadiometer and infantometer with a dry cloth or paper towel.  \n\nNote: Do not allow any fluid to drip into the housing of the digital measurement device.  \n\nCheck that the head/foot piece of the stadiometer and infantometer slides smoothly along the measurement column. Clean the aluminum track with a damp cloth or paper towel. As needed, lubricate the track with sewing machine oil—place a few drops of the oil along the track and then slide the head/foot piece up and down the column.  \n\n2.4 Equipment Malfunctions  \n\nAll equipment malfunctions or repair needs must be reported promptly to the technologist in charge of body measures, MEC manager, and home office component specialist. If the issue is computer related and cannot be resolved by the health technologist and/or MEC manager, please contact the home office ISIS support staff.  \n\nEquipment issues should be documented in the Unusual Field Occurrence (UFO) system and Equipment Tracking System (ETS) as appropriate (refer to the UFO Utility Manual and ETS User Guide for details). The component specialist will contact the equipment manufacturer for assistance.  \n\nA complete set of backup anthropometry equipment is kept at the home office for training and ISIS testing purposes. Some backup equipment for the anthropometry component is kept in each MEC for use until the malfunctioning equipment can be repaired or replaced. Specifically, two portable scales will serve as substitutes for the digital weight scale; spare knee calipers are kept in the cabinet.  \n\nThe ISIS anthropometry software application can be used in a manual data entry mode. This feature is especially valuable in the event that the stadiometer, infantometer, or digital weight scale fails to transfer data directly to ISIS. If the ISIS system fails to capture one or more data points, the examiner should complete a UFO, including the SP ID, the missing values, and a description of the problem encountered during the exam.  \n\nIf ISIS is completely unavailable for use during a session, the examiner can still perform the component. The recorder should record all measurements on the Body Measures Recording Form (see Appendix A). Several copies of the form should be kept in the cabinet drawer. MEC staff can obtain additional copies in the Blank Forms Directory on the MEC staff lounge computer or via an email request to the home office component specialist. Recorders should print all hard-copy form data legibly. The Body Measures Recording Form can be faxed or mailed to the home office. The component specialist will then complete a Back-End-Edit-Request (BEER) to add the data to the study database.  \n\n2.5 Setup Procedures  \n\nThe following procedures describe how to set up the anthropometry equipment and supplies at the start of a stand.  \n\n2.5.1 Calibration Weights  \n\nRemove the weight tray bolt to allow the tray to slide freely. Tape the bolt to the inside of the cabinet for easy access. Place the unfinished bumper board at the back of the weight tray.  \n\nUse the weights to calibrate the digital weight scale and portable scales (see Chapter 5, Quality Control, Section 5.2, Equipment Calibrations).  \n\n2.5.2 Digital Weight Scale  \n\nRemove the cover from the scale.   \nCalibrate the scale using the calibration weights (see Chapter 5, Quality Control, Section 5.2, Equipment Calibrations).   \nReturn the cover to the scale.  \n\n2.5.3 Portable Scale  \n\nRemove the wooden stick from the cabinet drawer handles and place it in the anthropometry storage container.   \nRemove the two portable scales from the cabinet drawers.   \nReconnect or replace the four AA batteries in each scale.   \nCalibrate the portable scales using the calibration weights (see Chapter 5, Quality Control, Section 5.2, Equipment Calibrations).   \nReturn the portable scales to the cabinet drawers.  \n\n2.5.4 Sitting Box  \n\nRemove the bungee cord from around the sitting box and store the strap in the anthropometry storage container.  \n\nLeave the sitting box against the corner wall where the mirrors are located.  \n\nRaise the seat located beside the sitting box.  \n\n2.5.5 Stadiometer  \n\nReplace the CR123 battery in the digital measurement device for the stadiometer.  \n\nCalibrate the stadiometer using the100-cm calibration rod (see Chapter 5, Quality Control, Section 5.2, Equipment Calibrations). When not in use, the rod should be kept in the holding grips on the side of the stadiometer.  \n\nSlide the head piece of the stadiometer to the top of the measurement column.  \n\n2.5.6 Infantometer  \n\nRemove the bungee cord from the infantometer and store it in the anthropometry storage container.   \nRemove the barcode wand and padding from between the foot piece and the headboard. Store the padding in the cabinet drawers.   \nReplace the CR123 battery in the digital measurement device of the infantometer. Calibrate the infantometer (see Chapter 5, Quality Control, Section 5.2, Equipment Calibrations).   \nNote: When calibrated, the result should read $0.0\\;\\mathrm{cm}$ .   \nSlide the foot piece of the infantometer to the left end of the measurement column.  \n\n2.5.7 Knee Caliper  \n\nIf not already done, remove the wooden brace from the cabinet drawers and place it in the anthropometry storage container. Remove one knee caliper from the cabinet drawers and place it on a wall hook.\n\nHeight adjustment A 15-centimeter (cm) plastic ruler is used to correct stature   \nruler: measurements when SPs have hair styles that interfere with the stadiometer headpiece placement, or when they are unwilling to remove their shoes. The recorder enters the height correction factor in ISIS, which automatically calculates an adjusted height value.   \nStadiometer calibration  A 100-cm metal rod is used to calibrate the stadiometer at the   \nrod: beginning of a stand and on a daily basis. When not in use, the rod is stored in the holding grips on the side of the stadiometer.   \nDigital weight scale: The digital weight scale used to weigh SPs is built into the exam room floor. This high-performance instrument is linked directly to the ISIS anthropometry application. The maximum capacity of the digital weight scale is 600 pounds.   \nPortable scales: Two portable scales are available in each MEC for use in the event of a malfunction of the digital weight scale, or if an SP’s weight exceeds the digital scale capacity. Each scale has a maximum capacity of 440 pounds. Four AA batteries are used to power each scale.   \nCalibration weights: Each MEC has a set of fifteen 10-kilogram $(\\mathrm{kg})$ weights. The weights are used to calibrate the portable scales at the beginning of a stand and to calibrate the digital weight scale daily and at the beginning, middle, and end of a stand. When not in use, the weights are stored on a sliding tray in the exam room cabinet.   \nSitting box: A blue rectangular box is used as a seat for the SP during the upper leg length measurement. Also, some children may need to stand on the box while the health technologist takes their body measurements.   \nKnee caliper: A metal, sliding caliper is used to mark the distal end of the femur in the determination of the upper leg length. When not in use, the caliper is stored in a protective case in the cabinet drawer. Two knee calipers are available in each MEC.   \nSteel measuring tape: A retractable steel measuring tape is used to take length and circumference measurements.   \nChildren’s changing Changing table with safety rails that enclose all 4 sides. The table is   \ntable: used to lay the child and remove his/her clothing. This table meets or exceeds government and ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) safety standards  \n\nExhibits 2-1 to 2-10 show photos of the anthropometry equipment.  \n\nExhibit 2-1.

Knee caliper, tape measures, and ruler  \n\n  \n\n2.2.2 Supplies  \n\nBlack/white cosmetic pencil:  \n\nThe examiner and recorder make all body marks on the SP using a wax-based cosmetic pencil. The health tech will use an appropriate color so that the markings are clearly visible on the SP’s skin.  \n\nDrop dispenser:  \n\nA small dropper bottle is used to dispense baby oil to remove the cosmetic pencil marks.  \n\nBaby oil: Baby oil is supplied on each MEC for removing cosmetic pencil marks from the SP’s skin. A small drop dispenser holds the oil for use during exams. Refills are obtained from a larger bottle of baby oil that is stored in the cabinet drawer.   \nAbsorbent pad (Chux): A clean Chux pad is laid on the infantometer before each use. The pads may also be placed beneath an infant while the guardian removes the child’s clothing in preparation for taking measurements.   \nAlcohol wipes: Prepackaged alcohol wipes will be used daily by the technologist to clean the surface of equipment such as the knee calipers and tape measures.   \nBatteries: Two types of batteries—CR123 and AA. The CR123 batteries are used to power the digital measurement devices for the stadiometer and infantometer. The AA batteries are used to power the portable scales. Both types of batteries are removed at the end of a stand and replaced at the beginning of a stand.   \nDisinfectant wipes: A container of disinfectant wipes is provided in each MEC for cleaning the surface area of the infantometer, sitting box, and other areas that require cleaning as needed.   \nBlunt-edge scissors: Stainless steel, blunt-edge scissors are used by the technologist to cut the SP gown pants and shirt in preparation for leg and arm measurements.   \nCotton cloth: A cotton cloth is supplied in each MEC for wiping the surface of the aluminum track and digital measurement device of the stadiometer and infantometer.   \nGauze pads: Each MEC has a supply of $2\\mathrm{x}2$ inch gauze pads. The pads are used to wipe off cosmetic pencil marks with baby oil.   \nMasking tape: At the end of the anthropometry exam, the technologist tapes the exam gowns to afford privacy to the SP.   \nPaper: A white roll of paper will be used to cover the table before SPs lie down.   \nSanitizing wipes: A container of sanitizing wipes is provided for cleaning the surface area of the exam table and the abdominal caliper.", "files_in_pdf": [{"path": ".pdf_temp/viewrange_chunk_6_26_30_1765987187/images/jtpyzb.jpg", "size": 157927}, {"path": ".pdf_temp/viewrange_chunk_5_21_25_1765987187/images/hb0oqv.jpg", "size": 226228}, {"path": ".pdf_temp/viewrange_chunk_5_21_25_1765987187/images/nkbtfs.jpg", "size": 201824}, {"path": ".pdf_temp/viewrange_chunk_5_21_25_1765987187/images/shkoec.jpg", "size": 194092}, {"path": ".pdf_temp/viewrange_chunk_4_16_20_1765987188/images/ojv8zo.jpg", "size": 139018}, {"path": ".pdf_temp/viewrange_chunk_4_16_20_1765987188/images/ypm8ae.jpg", "size": 76859}, {"path": ".pdf_temp/viewrange_chunk_4_16_20_1765987188/images/t2ykn5.jpg", "size": 85675}, {"path": ".pdf_temp/viewrange_chunk_4_16_20_1765987188/images/8g62e4.jpg", "size": 131150}, {"path": ".pdf_temp/viewrange_chunk_4_16_20_1765987188/images/88c6e9.jpg", "size": 87755}, {"path": ".pdf_temp/viewrange_chunk_4_16_20_1765987188/images/bofrci.jpg", "size": 156157}, {"path": ".pdf_temp/viewrange_chunk_4_16_20_1765987188/images/2pifk8.jpg", "size": 137509}, {"path": ".pdf_temp/viewrange_chunk_4_16_20_1765987188/images/s98dc7.jpg", "size": 115371}, {"path": ".pdf_temp/viewrange_chunk_4_16_20_1765987188/images/npk4ny.jpg", "size": 221814}]}
