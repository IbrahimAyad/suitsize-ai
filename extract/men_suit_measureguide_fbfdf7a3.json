We know that every man is different. Your size, posture, figure, and the \nshape of your body all change the way your suit fits. This is why we have prepared a comprehensive \nguide to help you take the perfect measurements for your bespoke suit. \nWe know that taking measurements can be a chore, so we have worked hard to make it as easy and \nquickly as possible for you.  \n \nWhat you will need: \n A fabric measuring tape (fabric only). \n Assistance from a friend \n A well fitting suit, shirt, pair of trousers (not jeans), and a pair of shoes.  \n \n \nWhen taking measurements: \n Keep the measuring tape comfortably snug, but not tight. \n All measurements should be made to nearest inch / centimeter. \n \nThe following sections provide instructions on how you can create your own perfect bespoke suit. These \nthree (3) measurement methods are completely different from each other but should yield the same \nresult.  The steps within each of these methods are not to be interchanged: \n SUIT MEASUREMENT METHOD. Measure your best fitting suit.  “RECOMMENDED ” \no Measure the suit the fits you well and enter the suit measurements through the control panel. \n BODY MEASUREMENT METHOD. Measure your body.  \no Ask someone to take your own measurements then create your body measurements profile \nonline. Many customers get this wrong the first time, so if you do not have experience doing \nthis, please use “Suit Measurements Method”. \n Send us your best fitting suit.  \n  \nModerntailor \nAttention : Gong Hongyue \nAddress : Nantong Moja trade Co., Ltd, 16F Qirui Plaza, No.1, Chongwen Road, \nChongchuan District, Nantong City, Jiangsu, China  226007 \nPhone number: 13606292807 \n \n In sending your best fitting suit, you may send it to us via first class mail.
