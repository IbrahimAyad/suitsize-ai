# Research Plan: Regular Suits 46R-50R with 6-Drop System

## Task Overview
Research and document comprehensive suit measurements for Regular suits sizes 46R, 48R, 50R with 6-drop system.

## Research Objectives
1. **Industry-standard body measurements** (chest, waist, hips, shoulders, sleeve length, jacket length)
2. **Anthropometric data** linking height/weight to specific suit measurements for men 5'6"-6'1"
3. **Professional tailoring standards** for slim-cut Regular suits
4. **6-drop system mechanics** for Regular fits (pants waist = jacket size - 6)
5. **Real-world sizing examples** from major menswear brands

## Research Tasks

### Phase 1: Baseline Understanding
- [x] 1.1 Review provided XSuit measurements reference
- [x] 1.2 Review Phase 1 research methodology
- [x] 1.3 Establish baseline understanding of suit sizing standards

### Phase 2: Industry Standards Research
- [x] 2.1 Research industry-standard body measurements for Regular suits
- [x] 2.2 Find anthropometric data for men 5'6"-6'1" height range
- [x] 2.3 Research professional tailoring standards for slim-cut Regular suits
- [x] 2.4 Investigate 6-drop system mechanics and applications

### Phase 3: Brand-Specific Research
- [x] 3.1 Research Suitsupply sizing for 46R, 48R, 50R
- [x] 3.2 Research Indochino sizing for target sizes
- [x] 3.3 Research Nordstrom sizing for target sizes
- [x] 3.4 Research other major brands (Hugo Boss, Brooks Brothers, etc.)
- [x] 3.5 Compare and analyze brand variations

### Phase 4: Anthropometric Analysis
- [x] 4.1 Analyze height/weight to measurement correlations
- [x] 4.2 Create measurement charts for different body types
- [x] 4.3 Document slim-fit vs regular-fit differences

### Phase 5: Documentation
- [x] 5.1 Compile comprehensive findings
- [x] 5.2 Create measurement tables and charts
- [x] 5.3 Write final report with actionable insights
- [x] 5.4 Save to docs/regular_suits_46R_50R_research.md

## Success Criteria
- Complete measurement data for all three sizes (46R, 48R, 50R)
- Clear explanation of 6-drop system
- Multiple brand comparisons
- Anthropometric correlations for specified height range
- Professional tailoring standards documented
