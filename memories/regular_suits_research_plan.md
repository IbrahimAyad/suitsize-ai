# Research Plan: Regular Suit Sizes 34R, 36R, 38R with 6-Drop System

## Task Overview
Research and document comprehensive suit measurements for Regular suits sizes 34R, 36R, 38R with 6-drop system focus.

## Research Objectives
1. [x] Industry-standard body measurements (chest, waist, hips, shoulders, sleeve length, jacket length) for 34R, 36R, 38R
2. [x] Anthropometric data linking height/weight to specific suit measurements for men 5'6"-6'1"
3. [x] Professional tailoring standards for slim-cut Regular suits
4. [x] How the 6-drop system works (pants waist = jacket size - 6) for Regular fits
5. [x] Real-world sizing examples from major menswear brands (Zara, H&M, J.Crew, Banana Republic, etc.)

## Research Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Research
- [x] 1.1 Search for industry standards and tailoring guides for Regular fit suits
- [x] 1.2 Research anthropometric data for men in height range 5'6"-6'1"
- [x] 1.3 Study professional tailoring standards and measurement protocols

### Phase 2: Brand-Specific Data Collection
- [x] 2.1 Extract data from major brands: Zara, H&M, J.Crew, Banana Republic, Brooks Brothers
- [x] 2.2 Collect xSuit Regular fit data (from provided JSON)
- [x] 2.3 Research additional brands: Calvin Klein, Suitsupply, Indochino

### Phase 3: 6-Drop System Analysis
- [x] 3.1 Study 6-drop system implementation for Regular fits
- [x] 3.2 Compare with 7-drop and 8-drop systems for slim fits
- [x] 3.3 Analyze height/weight correlations for 6-drop system

### Phase 4: Professional Standards Research
- [x] 4.1 Research professional tailoring measurement standards
- [x] 4.2 Study anthropometric datasets and statistical foundations
- [x] 4.3 Analyze quality control standards in luxury menswear

### Phase 5: Data Synthesis and Documentation
- [x] 5.1 Consolidate all measurement data for 34R, 36R, 38R
- [x] 5.2 Create comprehensive brand comparison matrix
- [x] 5.3 Develop height/weight correlation guidelines
- [x] 5.4 Document 6-drop system implementation
