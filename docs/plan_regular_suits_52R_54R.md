# Research Plan: Regular Suits 52R & 54R with 6-Drop System

## Task Type: Verification-Focused Task
This research requires deep verification of specific suit measurements and standards for larger Regular suit sizes.

## Research Objectives
1. **Industry-Standard Body Measurements** - Document comprehensive measurements for 52R and 54R suits
2. **Anthropometric Data Analysis** - Link height/weight to suit measurements for men 5'6"-6'1"
3. **Professional Tailoring Standards** - Research standards for slim-cut Regular suits
4. **6-Drop System Implementation** - Verify how the 6-drop system works for Regular fits
5. **Brand Comparison Analysis** - Gather real-world examples from major menswear brands

## Research Plan

### Phase 1: Baseline Research and Data Collection
- [x] 1.1 Extract detailed measurements from xSuit 52R and 54R data (already available in input files)
- [x] 1.2 Search for anthropometric data and industry standards for larger suit sizes
- [x] 1.3 Research professional tailoring standards for Regular fit suits
- [x] 1.4 Investigate 6-drop system implementation for Regular fits
- [x] 1.5 Search for big & tall menswear brand sizing data

### Phase 2: Brand Research and Comparison
- [ ] 2.1 Research major brands offering 52R and 54R suits:
  - [ ] Brooks Brothers (luxury segment)
  - [ ] Men's Wearhouse (big & tall specialists)
  - [ ] Joseph A. Bank
  - [ ] Indochino (made-to-measure)
  - [ ] Suitsupply
  - [ ] J.Crew
  - [ ] H&M
  - [ ] Zara
- [ ] 2.2 Extract sizing charts and measurement data from each brand
- [ ] 2.3 Analyze 6-drop system implementation across brands
- [ ] 2.4 Document slim-cut Regular fit variations

### Phase 3: Anthropometric Analysis
- [ ] 3.1 Research height/weight correlations for men 5'6"-6'1"
- [ ] 3.2 Find anthropometric data linking body measurements to suit sizes
- [ ] 3.3 Analyze size progression patterns in larger suit sizes
- [ ] 3.4 Document frame size considerations for 52R and 54R

### Phase 4: Professional Standards Research
- [ ] 4.1 Research professional tailoring standards for Regular fit suits
- [ ] 4.2 Investigate slim-cut Regular suit construction standards
- [ ] 4.3 Document industry tolerance standards for larger sizes
- [ ] 4.4 Research garment measurement protocols

### Phase 5: Analysis and Synthesis
- [ ] 5.1 Compare measurement data across brands
- [ ] 5.2 Analyze 6-drop system consistency
- [ ] 5.3 Synthesize anthropometric correlations
- [ ] 5.4 Document findings and recommendations

### Phase 6: Report Generation
- [ ] 6.1 Compile comprehensive measurement tables
- [ ] 6.2 Create height/weight correlation analysis
- [ ] 6.3 Document 6-drop system implementation
- [ ] 6.4 Provide brand comparison analysis
- [ ] 6.5 Generate final research report

## Source Requirements
- Minimum 10 sources from at least 4 different domains
- Prioritize official brand size charts and industry standards
- Include academic/research sources for anthropometric data
- Verify data from multiple independent sources

## Success Criteria
- Complete measurement data for both 52R and 54R sizes
- Clear anthropometric correlations for specified height/weight range
- Comprehensive 6-drop system documentation
- Real-world examples from major brands
- Professional tailoring standards documentation
