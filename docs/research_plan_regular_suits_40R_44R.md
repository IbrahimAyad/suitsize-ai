# Regular Suits Research Plan (40R, 42R, 44R)

## Research Objectives
Comprehensive research and documentation of suit measurements for Regular suits sizes 40R, 42R, 44R with 6-drop system implementation.

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Foundation Research
- [x] 1.1 Analyze existing xSuit Regular length data for target sizes (40R, 42R, 44R)
- [x] 1.2 Research industry-standard body measurements for these jacket sizes
- [x] 1.3 Establish anthropometric correlations for height/weight to suit measurements (5'6"-6'1")

### Phase 2: Professional Standards Research
- [x] 2.1 Research professional tailoring standards for slim-cut Regular suits
- [x] 2.2 Investigate drop system variations for Regular vs Slim fits
- [x] 2.3 Document measurement protocols and quality standards

### Phase 3: Brand Comparison Analysis
- [x] 3.1 Research Brooks Brothers Regular fit measurements and policies
- [x] 3.2 Research Ralph Lauren Regular fit sizing and drop system
- [x] 3.3 Research Calvin Klein Regular suit measurements (limited access)
- [x] 3.4 Research other major brands (J.Crew, H&M, Zara) for comparison
- [x] 3.5 Analyze variations in 6-drop system implementation across brands

### Phase 4: Anthropometric Data Analysis
- [x] 4.1 Compile height/weight ranges for target sizes
- [x] 4.2 Research body type correlations (athletic, regular, broad)
- [x] 4.3 Analyze frame size variations within these size ranges

### Phase 5: 6-Drop System Deep Dive
- [x] 5.1 Document exact implementation for Regular fits
- [x] 5.2 Compare with short and long variations
- [x] 5.3 Research alteration requirements and recommendations

### Phase 6: Documentation and Synthesis
- [x] 6.1 Compile comprehensive measurement tables
- [x] 6.2 Create height/weight correlation charts
- [x] 6.3 Document brand comparison findings
- [x] 6.4 Create final research report

## Key Research Questions
1. What are the specific garment measurements for 40R, 42R, 44R Regular suits?
2. How do major brands implement the 6-drop system for Regular fits?
3. What anthropometric data exists for men 5'6"-6'1" in these size ranges?
4. How do professional tailoring standards vary for slim-cut Regular suits?
5. What are the real-world size variations across different brands?

## Expected Deliverables
- Comprehensive measurement tables for 40R, 42R, 44R
- Height/weight correlation analysis for 5'6"-6'1" range
- Brand comparison matrix with drop system analysis
- Professional tailoring standards documentation
- Final research report with actionable insights

## Source Requirements
- Minimum 5 major menswear brands
- Professional tailoring and measurement guides
- Anthropometric studies and data
- Industry standards and best practices
