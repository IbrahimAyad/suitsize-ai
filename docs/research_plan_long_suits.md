# Long Suits Height/Weight Measurement Mapping - Research Plan

## Task Overview
Research and create data mapping linking height/weight combinations to specific suit measurements for Long suits (38L-54L). Build upon existing Short and Regular suit research to create comprehensive analysis.

## Key Research Areas

### 1. Anthropometric Studies for Tall Men (6'1"+)
- [x] 1.1 Search for anthropometric data specifically for tall men (6'1"+)
- [x] 1.2 Identify body proportion differences between average and tall men
- [x] 1.3 Find studies on how height affects torso/limb proportions
- [x] 1.4 Research shoulder height, sleeve length, and torso length variations

### 2. Long Suit Size Analysis (38L-54L)
- [x] 2.1 Research comprehensive Long suit size charts from major brands
- [x] 2.2 Collect measurement data for jacket sizes 38L-54L
- [x] 2.3 Analyze chest, shoulder, sleeve, and jacket length measurements
- [x] 2.4 Document standard inseam and rise lengths for Long suits

### 3. Body Type Impact on Long Suits
- [x] 3.1 Research how slim body types affect Long suit fit
- [x] 3.2 Analyze regular body type proportions in Long suits
- [x] 3.3 Study broad/inverted triangle builds and Long suit adjustments
- [x] 3.4 Investigate athletic builds and Long suit considerations
- [x] 3.5 Examine frame size impact (small, medium, large) on Long suits

### 4. Height/Weight to Size Mapping
- [x] 4.1 Create height/weight ranges for each Long suit size (38L-54L)
- [x] 4.2 Analyze typical wearer profiles for each size
- [x] 4.3 Identify overlap zones between adjacent sizes
- [x] 4.4 Document body shape considerations within size ranges

### 5. Mathematical Models and Prediction
- [x] 5.1 Research existing mathematical models for tall men's sizing
- [x] 5.2 Analyze regression models for Long suit measurements
- [x] 5.3 Study machine learning approaches to suit sizing
- [x] 5.4 Develop height/weight to measurement prediction formulas
- [x] 5.5 Create adjustment factors for different body types

### 6. Comparative Analysis
- [x] 6.1 Compare Long suits to Regular suits proportions
- [x] 6.2 Analyze differences between Long and Short suit measurements
- [x] 6.3 Study height transition zones (when to choose Long vs Regular)
- [x] 6.4 Document proportional scaling factors across lengths

### 7. Brand Analysis and Industry Standards
- [x] 7.1 Analyze major brand approaches to Long suit sizing
- [x] 7.2 Study industry standardization efforts
- [x] 7.3 Document variations in drop systems for Long suits
- [x] 7.4 Research luxury vs mass market Long suit differences

### 8. Technical Implementation
- [x] 8.1 Create decision algorithms for Long suit selection
- [x] 8.2 Develop confidence scoring for recommendations
- [x] 8.3 Design alteration guidelines for Long suits
- [x] 8.4 Create implementation framework for sizing systems

## Expected Deliverables
1. Comprehensive Long suit measurement mapping report
2. Height/weight to size correlation tables
3. Body type adjustment matrices
4. Mathematical prediction models
5. Comparative analysis with Short/Regular suits
6. Implementation guidelines for sizing systems

## Research Sources Priority
1. Anthropometric studies (NCSU, military data, fashion research)
2. Major brand size charts (Brooks Brothers, J.Crew, H&M, Zara, etc.)
3. Professional tailoring guides and standards
4. Academic research on tall men's proportions
5. Industry reports on menswear sizing
