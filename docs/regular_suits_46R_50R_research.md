# Regular Suits 46R–50R with 6-Drop System: Standards, Anthropometrics, Brand Examples, and Tailoring Guidance

## Executive Summary: What 46R–50R Regular Suits Require

Regular-length suits sized 46R, 48R, and 50R serve a critical band of the men’s sizing spectrum. Across brands, “Regular” (R) typically aligns with men in the approximate height band of 5'8" to 6'2", with individual labels sometimes extending toward 6'3" or shortening to 6'0" depending on the brand’s block. Within that band, the most consistent sizing anchors are the chest, shoulder, sleeve, and jacket length measurements, and—on the trouser side—the waist, rise, hip, and inseam. When mapped through the industry-standard 6-drop system (Classic/Regular suits), the jacket size implies a pant waist six inches smaller: 46→40, 48→42, and 50→44. These anchors provide a practical, robust starting point for ready-to-wear (RTW) recommendations and made-to-measure (MTM) specifications alike.[^2][^1][^3]

Three measurement domains matter most for fit outcomes and customer satisfaction:
- Jacket structural measurements (shoulder, chest, sleeve, center-back length) determine the upper-body silhouette, movement, and visual balance.
- Trouser measurements (waist, hip, rise, inseam) determine comfort, break, and drape—while the drop links jacket and pant sizing.
- Height/weight and body shape determine length selection, drop selection, and the likelihood of needing alterations or separates.

Brand practices diverge in both transparency and numeric specifics. Some provide comprehensive garment measurements (e.g., xSuit), while others publish body measurement ranges or fit offsets (e.g., Brooks Brothers Regent), and many rely on body-based guidance and fit language (e.g., Suitsupply). This variability requires a practical algorithm that starts with chest measurement as the primary size cue, applies length selection by height, checks over-arm thresholds that can nudge size selection, and pairs jackets and pants through the 6-drop for Regular suits—with dynamic overrides when a customer’s build or preference argues for separates or a different drop.[^4][^5][^1][^8]

The remainder of this report operationalizes those rules. It lays out industry definitions and protocols, compiles cross-brand data for 46R–50R, translates anthropometric ranges into practical guidance, explains the 6-drop system and its deviations, and provides concrete examples and implementation logic that menswear brands, product teams, tailors, and e-commerce sizing tools can use to improve first-time fit.

## Definitions, Standards, and Measurement Protocols

In menswear, the numeric size corresponds to the chest measurement (in inches in the U.S. system), and the letter indicates jacket length—Short (S), Regular (R), or Long (L). Regular is the most common length and typically targets men of average height and proportions; brands commonly map R-lengths to approximately 5'8"–6'2", with some specifying slightly narrower or broader bands. For example, Nordstrom identifies R-length as suitable for roughly 5'8" to 6'2", while an aggregated sizing chart cites ranges more like 6'0"–6'3" for the upper sizes in this report’s focus. In practice, a brand’s block and target demographic drive the precise band.[^2][^3]

Drop systems link jacket and trouser sizes. The most widely used convention for Classic/Regular suits is a 6-drop: jacket size minus six equals pant waist. Trim and Extra-Trim fits often use larger drops (7" and 8" respectively), reflecting narrower waists relative to the same chest size. The “over-arm” rule is a pragmatic adjustment: if a customer’s over-arm measurement exceeds their chest by more than seven inches, they should size up in the jacket to prevent upper-arm and back tension or pulling across the shoulders. This single check avoids many upper-body fit failures in RTW blocks.[^2]

Measurement protocols separate body measurement from garment measurement. Body measurements are the customer’s own dimensions; garment measurements are the flat-lay or circumference specs of the produced jacket and trouser. For both, consistent posture and tape placement matter: chest and over-arm are taken with arms relaxed, the tape level around the body; waist at the natural crease; sleeve from the shoulder seam to the wrist with arm relaxed; center-back length from the base of the neck to the desired hem. MTM protocols stress not adding ease yourself—the tailor applies the appropriate ease for the selected fit. The xSuit measurement set—shoulder, chest, waist, hip, center-back, sleeve, bicep, and sleeve opening—illustrates the granularity that helps diagnose fit issues and alteration feasibility. For fused, non-canvassed RTW suits, many manufacturers explicitly discourage structural alterations outside hemming.[^7][^6][^1]

To ground these concepts, Table 1 summarizes the most common suit measurements, how to take them, and typical use.

To illustrate the core measurement vocabulary and protocols used throughout this report, the following table consolidates definitions and practical tips.

Table 1. Measurement glossary and protocols

| Measurement | What it is | How to measure (body) | Typical use in sizing |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chest | Upper torso circumference at the fullest part | Tape level under armpits over chest/shoulder blades; arms relaxed | Primary jacket size anchor; core chest ease applied by brand |
| Over-arm | Shoulder breadth including upper arms | Tape around the broadest part of shoulders and upper arms | Size-up trigger if > chest + 7" to avoid shoulder tension |
| Shoulder | Shoulder seam to shoulder seam across back | Straight line across back from shoulder point to point | Jacket silhouette and armhole placement; structural fit |
| Sleeve | Shoulder seam to wrist bone | With arm relaxed, measure to second knuckle/wrist | Sleeve length; cuff show; proportion relative to height |
| Center-back length | Base of neck to jacket hem | With head neutral, measure along spine | Jacket proportion; R-length mapping; balance with sleeve |
| Waist (body) | Natural waistline | At natural crease; comfortable tension | Trouser waist selection; drop logic anchor |
| Hip | widest part of buttocks | Level tape; two fingers under for ease | Trouser fit over seat/hips; balance with rise |
| Inseam | Inside leg crotch to hem | Measure along inside leg from crotch to desired hem | Trouser break and overall length |
| Rise | Front and back rise (body or garment) | From waistband at crotch to opposite point (body); or garment PTM | Comfort, sit stance, and drape |

Sources emphasize measuring the body, not a favorite garment, except when using a well-fitting jacket’s center-back seam solely as a length reference. For pant fit, measure inseam on a pair that fits as you want at the shoe. The aim is consistency, not compression.[^2][^7][^6]

![Nordstrom fit and measurement overview (Classic/Trim/Extra-Trim), illustrating practical measurement posture and fit categories.](.pdf_temp/subset_1_20_c9432ff3_1765989595/images/wnnhj7.jpg)

As shown above, brands often explain fit categories (Classic/Regular, Trim, Extra-Trim) alongside how to measure. These diagrams reinforce that the numeric size maps to chest, the letter to length, and the fit category to how much ease the brand builds into chest, waist, and sleeves.[^2]

### Suit Sizing Fundamentals

In the U.S., the jacket size number approximates the wearer’s chest circumference in inches. The letter—S/R/L—indicates jacket length: Short for shorter torsos and limbs, Regular for average, Long for longer torsos and arms. While some brands offer Extra Short/Extra Long, the tri-letter convention dominates. Length choice is a visual and functional decision: too short a jacket compromises coverage and balance; too long a jacket shortens the leg line and distorts proportion.[^6][^2]

### Drop Systems and Over-Arm Sizing Logic

- Classic/Regular suits typically use a 6-drop: 46R→40 waist, 48R→42 waist, 50R→44 waist.
- Trim and Extra-Trim suits often use larger drops—commonly 7" and 8"—to narrow the trouser waist relative to the same chest size.
- Over-arm guidance: If over-arm exceeds chest by more than seven inches, size up the jacket to preserve shoulder comfort and avoid pulling across the upper back and sleeves.[^2][^1]

### Measurement Protocols

Professional protocols emphasize:
- Posture: Stand naturally; arms relaxed; head neutral; breathe normally.
- Tape behavior: Keep circumference tapes horizontal; avoid pulling tight; let the tape lie flat.
- Measurements: Measure both limbs when asymmetry is likely; report the larger value for circumferences like biceps and thighs.
- Body vs garment: Submit body measurements for MTM; do not add “ease” yourself. A tailor adds ease per the chosen fit. For RTW fused suits, many brands warn against structural alterations aside from hemming, which has implications for returns and warranty coverage.[^7][^6][^1]

## Anthropometric Data and Height/Weight Mapping for 5'6"–6'1"

Height/weight is an efficient but blunt instrument for sizing. It works best as a screening tool to choose length and suggest a starting size, with the expectation that chest and other direct measurements will refine the recommendation. Aggregated charts show that within the 46R–50R band, height often spans approximately 6'0"–6'3" and weight can range widely, reflecting differences in build, muscle, and fat distribution. For instance, a representative sizing chart indicates:
- 46R: height ~6'0"–6'3", weight ~210–220 lbs
- 48R: height ~6'1"–6'5", weight ~240–260 lbs
- 50R: height ~6'1"–6'5", weight ~240–260 lbs[^3]

These ranges overlap across sizes and are not prescriptive; they simply reflect the demographic blocks many brands target for R-length suits. For customers near the boundaries—particularly those with larger over-arm measurements, prominent shoulder types, or athletic builds—direct body measurements and fit testing are essential to confirm size and length. Anthropometric datasets from 3D body scanning and national surveys provide the statistical basis for size spans and variance, but in commerce, chest circumference remains the primary anchor because it drives the jacket’s structural fit and is simplest for customers to measure consistently.[^9][^2][^6]

To make these proxies actionable, Table 2 provides a practical mapping of height to length selection, using chest measurement to anchor the numeric size, and noting the over-arm exception.

Table 2. Height band to length selection and 6-drop starting point (for Regular)

| Height band | Length selection | Starting jacket size | Starting pant waist (6-drop) | Over-arm exception |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5'6"–5'8" | Short (S) if proportions warrant; otherwise Regular | Use chest measurement | Jacket size − 6 | If over-arm > chest + 7", consider sizing up jacket |
| 5'8"–6'2" | Regular (R) | Use chest measurement | Jacket size − 6 | Same over-arm check applies |
| 6'2"–6'5"+ | Long (L) or R depending on torso length | Use chest measurement | Jacket size − 6 | Over-arm check; consider Long if sleeves and body feel short |

In practice, a customer who is 6'0" with a 46" chest but a 54" over-arm should try a 48R to accommodate shoulder breadth, then assess sleeve and body length for a possible move to Long. Conversely, a 5'9" customer with a 50" chest and a modest over-arm may prefer 50R, with pants sized by drop, but should confirm sleeve and jacket length visually.[^2][^3]

## Industry Measurement Standards for Regular Suits (46R–50R)

Because brands vary in what they publish, it is useful to triangulate across multiple sources. For structural jacket metrics in Regular length, a consolidated dataset shows useful convergence and variance points.

- Chest: Consistent at the label number (46R = 46" chest, etc.) per U.S. convention.[^2]
- Shoulders: Typically increase by 0.5" per size in Regular; measured shoulder values around 20.75" (46R) and 21.75" (48R/50R) in a representative consolidated chart.[^3]
- Sleeve: Often in the mid-30s for Regular-length blocks (e.g., 35" as a common value).[^3]
- Center-back length: Around 31.5"–31.75" for 46R–50R Regular, depending on brand and block.[^3]

xSuit’s detailed garment measurements add granularity across shoulder, chest, waist, hip, sleeve, center-back, bicep, and sleeve opening for Short/Regular/Long, enabling precise diagnosis and alteration decisions. For example, xSuit Regular lengths for 46–50 show chest moving from 24.0" to 25.6" across the three sizes (garment circumference), center-back length from 30.1" to 30.5", and sleeve length from 25.7" to 25.9". These figures illustrate the garment’s actual cut and ease, which differ from the wearer’s body measurements but correlate predictably with them across brands.[^1]

Table 3 compares the consolidatedRegular-length jacket specifications for 46R–50R. Values synthesize brand guidance and consolidated charts; garment-specific figures (e.g., xSuit) illustrate cut/ease rather than replacing body-based sizing.

Table 3. Regular-length jacket specs (46R–50R): consolidated view

| Size | Chest (label) | Shoulder (in) | Sleeve (in) | Center-back (in) | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 46R | 46 | ~20.75 | ~35.0 | ~31.5 | Over-arm rule applies if >53" |
| 48R | 48 | ~21.75 | ~35.0 | ~31.75 | Over-arm rule applies if >55" |
| 50R | 50 | ~21.75 | ~35.0 | ~31.75 | Over-arm rule applies if >57" |

Sources: consolidated sizing chart and brand guidance on over-arm and drop.[^3][^2] For a garment cut example that informs e-commerce P2M (points of measure) and fit diagnostics, see Table 4.

Table 4. xSuit 5.0 Regular-length jacket measurements (garment specs)

| Size | Shoulder (in) | Chest (in) | Waist (in) | Hip (in) | Center-back (in) | Sleeve (in) | Sleeve bicep (in) | Sleeve opening (in) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 46 | 19.5 | 24.0 | 22.0 | 23.4 | 30.1 | 25.7 | 8.4 | 5.7 |
| 48 | 19.9 | 24.8 | 22.8 | 24.2 | 30.3 | 25.8 | 8.7 | 5.9 |
| 50 | 20.3 | 25.6 | 23.6 | 25.0 | 30.5 | 25.9 | 8.9 | 6.1 |

Note: xSuit publishes garment measurements; the jacket’s numeric size refers to the size label, not the chest circumference in inches. These values are useful for diagnosing how a specific garment will fit relative to body measurements and for assessing alteration options.[^1]

![Consolidated size chart snapshot (46R–50R) for reference.](.pdf_temp/subset_1_30_22f2b6e2_1765989559/images/688jgr.jpg)

This consolidated view underscores two practical points. First, shoulder and sleeve increments across sizes are modest, which is why small changes in posture or measuring technique can change perceived fit. Second, center-back length is relatively stable in Regular blocks for these sizes; for many wearers, sleeve length and jacket button stance will drive the visual “rightness” more than small differences in center-back length.[^3]

## Professional Tailoring Standards for Slim-Cut Regular Suits

“Regular” does not mean boxy. Modern Regular suits—especially those labeled Tailored or Regent—balance comfort with a clean silhouette: they give room in the chest and body without excess fabric, and they maintain clean shoulder lines and sleeve hangs. In the Brooks Brothers taxonomy, Regent (their Regular/Tailored Classic) trims the chest and body compared to Madison (Relaxed), while Milano is slimmer still, with explicit offsets: approximately −1.5" chest and −1" waist versus Regent for Milano; approximately +3" chest and +5" waist for Madison versus Regent.[^5] Retail fit language often mirrors this: Suitsupply’s Tailored Fit (e.g., Milano with structured shoulders, Havana with natural shoulders) delivers a closer silhouette through chest and waist than Relaxed (e.g., Roma).[^8]

Acceptable alterations depend on construction. For canvassed or half-canvassed suits, tailors can adjust shoulders, sleeves, waist suppression, and trouser alterations to refine fit. For fused suits, many manufacturers caution against structural changes beyond hemming; fused constructions lack the拆/建 flexibility of canvassed garments and often void warranties or return eligibility if altered. This single fact drives a disproportionate share of returns in e-commerce: customers request shoulder or sleeve adjustments on fused RTW and discover post-alteration that the garment is no longer returnable or covered. Clear pre-purchase guidance reduces this risk.[^1][^5][^8]

Table 5 clarifies typical fit offsets and how they translate to tailoring latitude.

Table 5. Fit offsets and tailoring latitude

| Fit (relative to Regent/Regular) | Chest offset | Waist offset | Typical tailoring latitude | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Slim (e.g., Milano) | −1.5" | −1.0" | Canvassed: moderate shoulder/sleeve adjust; waist suppression limited by existing seam allowances | Tighter upper arm and higher armholes common |
| Regular/Tailored (Regent) | 0 | 0 | Canvassed: good latitude for sleeve, shoulder, waist tweaks | Baseline for offsets |
| Relaxed (Madison) | +3.0" | +5.0" | Canvassed: more to take in; caution on shoulder width reductions | Roomier through chest and body |

Sleeve and shoulder targets remain non-negotiable for a professional look: sleeves should break just at the wrist bone with a quarter to a half inch of shirt cuff showing; shoulder seams should land at the natural shoulder endpoint without dimpling or gaping. These markers, more than any single measurement, telegraph “tailored” rather than “off-the-rack.”[^6][^5]

## The 6-Drop System Applied to Regular Fits

The 6-drop system is the default mapping for Classic/Regular suits in the U.S. market: pant waist equals jacket size minus six inches. This convention is simple, transparent, and a reliable starting point when the customer’s body measurements are not available or when ordering RTW sets. It also creates a shared language across brands and fitters: a 46R jacket and a 40 waist pant constitute a matched set in a 6-drop context.

Table 6. 6-drop mapping for 46R–50R

| Jacket size | Pant waist (6-drop) |
|---:|---:|
| 46R | 40 |
| 48R | 42 |
| 50R | 44 |

Trim and Extra-Trim suits frequently employ larger drops—commonly 7" and 8"—to narrow the trouser silhouette while preserving the same jacket chest. These are design choices as much as functional ones; the larger drop complements a slimmer jacket silhouette and keeps the wearer’s profile cohesive from top to bottom.[^2][^1] In practice:
- If a customer prefers a slimmer leg, consider moving to a 7-drop or 8-drop within the same jacket size, or buy separates to preserve jacket fit while tailoring the waist and leg profile.
- If the customer’s measured waist is materially larger than the drop-implied waist, buy separates (jacket by chest; trousers by waist) and plan minor waist suppression or letting out at the side seams as appropriate.[^2][^1]

Alteration allowances matter. Many RTW trousers include enough fabric at the side seams to let out approximately 1–2 inches at the waist, and they can always be taken in. Inseam is readily adjustable, but radical changes to rise and thigh width are limited without re-cutting. For fused RTW suits, avoid structural jacket alterations aside from hemming unless the brand explicitly allows it.[^2][^1]

## Real-World Sizing Examples by Brand (46R–50R)

Brands differ in what they publish, how they name fits, and whether they provide body measurements or garment measurements. The matrix below highlights the practical implications for 46R–50R.

Table 7. Brand comparison matrix for 46R–50R

| Brand | Fit names | Drop policy (stated or typical) | Lengths offered | Measurements published | Notes/caveats |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| xSuit | Classic/Slim/Modern/Tailored (brand taxonomy) | Not explicitly stated; examples use 6-drop | Short/Regular/Long | Detailed garment metrics across jacket and pants | Fused construction; alterations beyond hemming not recommended[^1] |
| Nordstrom (Guide) | Classic, Trim, Extra-Trim | Classic: 6-drop; Trim: 7-drop; Extra-Trim: 8-drop | Short, Regular, Long | Body measurement guidance and conversions | Clear over-arm rule; Big Suits classification at 48+[^2] |
| Brooks Brothers | Milano (Slim), Regent (Tailored Classic/Regular), Madison (Relaxed) | Uses 6-drop in Classic/Regular context | Regular; inseam variants | Body measurements; explicit fit offsets | Regent is best-seller; offsets quantify differences[^5] |
| Suitsupply | Tailored (Milano structured; Havana natural), Relaxed (Roma) | Not explicitly stated; Tailored implies narrower silhouette | Jacket lengths per model | Fit language; no full numeric tables at these sizes | In-store Size Passport and alterations; fit-first guidance[^8][^10] |
| Hugo Boss | Regular/Long/Stocky conversions | Conversion focus; drop not detailed | Regular/Long/Stocky | International conversions only | Use conversions; verify fit via product pages[^11] |
| SuitShop | Standard RTW charts | Typically 6-drop for Classic | Short/Regular/Long (varies) | Body measurement ranges and garment notes | Practical RTW guidance; verify per style[^12] |
| Suit Outlets (example chart) | Classic RTW ranges | Typical 6-drop | Short/Regular/Long | Body measurement ranges | Useful for e-commerce starting points[^13] |
| Indochino | MTM (customer’s body measurements) | Drop not applicable (custom) | N/A | MTM measurement protocol | Builds to customer’s measurements; brand provides detailed guides[^4] |
| Oliver Wicks | RTW with detailed specs | 6-drop for Classic fits | Short/Regular/Long | Detailed measurement tables and sizing logic | Good source for P2M and sizing education[^6] |

A few brand-specific highlights help translate these differences into buying and alteration decisions:

- xSuit provides detailed garment measurements for Short/Regular/Long across sizes 46–50, which are invaluable for diagnosing how a particular cut will look on a specific body and for pre-empting alteration requests. However, fused construction limits safe alterations to hemming.[^1]
- Nordstrom’s guide makes two rules easy to operationalize in e-commerce: use the over-arm threshold to size up and apply the appropriate drop by fit. It also defines the “Big Suits” class for 48+ chest, which can inform product page warnings about returns and alterations.[^2]
- Brooks Brothers’ Regent fit provides a clean baseline for “Regular,” with explicit offsets versus Milano and Madison. This clarity helps customers self-select and helps brands calibrate their own fit taxonomy.[^5]
- Suitsupply focuses on fit language and in-store services (Size Passport, alterations), which is excellent for precise fitting but requires a store visit or virtual consultation for numeric detail at 46R–50R.[^8][^10]
- Hugo Boss publishes conversions rather than detailed measurements; for these sizes, teams should rely on product-level specs and in-person fitting to finalize size and length.[^11]
- Indochino’s MTM model removes RTW guesswork by designing to the customer’s measurements; for multi-brand retailers, Indochino’s protocol is a useful benchmark for how to collect and verify customer inputs.[^4]

### xSuit 5.0 (Garment Measurements: Short/Regular/Long)

xSuit’s garment data exemplifies what e-commerce teams wish every brand published. For Regular length, sizes 46–50 show monotonic increases across shoulder, chest, waist, hip, sleeve, and center-back. The increment per size is modest, reinforcing the importance of accurate measurement and the value of detailed P2M. Because the construction is fused, alteration options are limited; teams should guide customers toward separates or brand-approved tailors for any structural work beyond hemming.[^1]

### Nordstrom Fit & Measurement Guide

Nordstrom’s guide operationalizes two high-value rules: the over-arm exception and fit-specific drops. It also clarifies length bands and U.S.–EU chest conversions—useful when aligning size tables across brands and markets. Product pages and store fittings should highlight these rules to preempt common sizing mistakes.[^2]

![Nordstrom: Classic/Trim/Extra-Trim visual guide for fit distinctions.](.pdf_temp/subset_1_20_c9432ff3_1765989595/images/30t9nt.jpg)

The visual differentiation between Classic, Trim, and Extra-Trim helps customers self-identify the silhouette they prefer. Translating that into numeric drop values reduces returns by aligning leg width with jacket silhouette.[^2]

### Brooks Brothers (Regent Fit: Regular/Tailored Classic)

Regent serves as the reference Regular fit at Brooks Brothers. Milano (slimmest) and Madison (relaxed) are quantified relative to Regent through chest and waist offsets. Publishing these offsets is rare in the industry and exceptionally helpful for customers deciding between fits—and for product teams building size calculators.[^5]

### Suitsupply (Fit Language and Services)

Suitsupply emphasizes fit first—Milano’s structured shoulder and Havana’s natural shoulder under the Tailored umbrella; Roma as a Relaxed option. Numeric tables for 46R–50R are not publicly centralized; however, the Size Passport and in-store tailoring provide high-fidelity sizing and alteration pathways. For brands without physical tailoring, these services are a useful benchmark for customer experience design.[^8][^10]

### Indochino (Made-to-Measure Baseline)

Indochino’s MTM process standardizes measurement capture with detailed protocols (neck, shoulder-to-shoulder, sleeve, chest, waist, hips, outseam, rise, thigh, knee). For multi-brand retailers, these instructions double as best-practice user guidance when collecting customer measurements for non-MTM products. MTM eliminates drop guesswork by constructing garments to the customer’s body measurements.[^4]

### Hugo Boss (Conversions and Fit Options)

Hugo Boss provides robust international conversions, including Regular/Long/Stocky options. For 46R–50R, teams should convert to EU equivalents (56/58/60) and confirm fit via product pages or in-store fitting. Boss’s fit taxonomy supports broader length and build choices but does not substitute for direct measurements.[^11]

### SuitShop, Suit Outlets (RTW Chart Examples)

Retailers like SuitShop and Suit Outlets publish practical charts and ranges. For 46R–50R, expect body measurement ranges, drop conventions, and inseam options. These resources are useful for e-commerce starting points but should be paired with brand-specific product specs to avoid missteps at the edge of size bands.[^12][^13]

## Practical Sizing and Alteration Recommendations for 46R–50R

A practical algorithm blends the few rules that consistently work in stores with the realities of brand variability and construction types.

1. Start with chest measurement. This is the primary jacket size cue. Do not “fudge” chest up or down to chase length or drop—choose the jacket size that matches the chest.[^2][^6]
2. Apply the over-arm exception. If over-arm exceeds chest by more than seven inches, size up the jacket. This prevents shoulder and upper-back pulling and preserves sleeve comfort.[^2]
3. Select length by height and proportions. For 5'8"–6'2", Regular is the usual starting point. If the customer has a long torso or prefers more coverage, Long may be more harmonious; if torso and limbs are proportionally short, Short can improve balance.[^2][^3]
4. Pair trousers by drop, then refine. For Regular suits, begin with the 6-drop: 46→40, 48→42, 50→44. Confirm waist comfort and rise with the customer; if the implied waist is too tight or too loose, buy separates and tailor the waist or leg as needed.[^2][^1]
5. Favor separates when the drop conflicts with body reality. Athletic builds (large chest-to-waist ratio) and customers with non-average rises often need separates: jacket by chest, trousers by waist and rise. Plan side-seam letting out (often 1–2") and taking in as required.[^2][^1]
6. Set alteration expectations by construction. For fused RTW suits, limit structural jacket alterations to hemming; canvassed or half-canvassed garments can accommodate shoulder, sleeve, and waist adjustments. Always disclose manufacturer policies to reduce post-alteration returns.[^1][^5]

To make this concrete, Table 8 compiles decision rules that e-commerce teams and store associates can apply quickly.

Table 8. Decision rules for 46R–50R (Regular)

| Input | Rule | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Chest = 46" | Primary size cue | Try 46R jacket |
| Over-arm > 53" | Size-up exception | Try 48R jacket instead |
| Height 5'8"–6'2" | Length default | Start with Regular |
| Long torso or arms | Length adjustment | Consider Long |
| Prefer slimmer leg | Drop adjustment | Consider 7-drop or 8-drop within same jacket size |
| Waist tight at drop-implied value | Separate or alter | Buy separates (jacket by chest; trouser by waist) or tailor waist within seam allowance |
| Waist loose at drop-implied value | Separate or alter | Buy separates; take in waist as needed; confirm rise |
| Fused RTW suit | Alteration policy | Hemming only; structural changes void warranty/returns in many cases |

Finally, communicate fit expectations. Table 9 lists standard targets and acceptable tolerance bands—these are the checks that separate “off-the-rack” from “tailored.”

Table 9. Fit targets and acceptable tolerance bands

| Area | Target | Acceptable band | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Shoulder seam | Ends at natural shoulder | ±1/4" from bone end | No dimpling or gaping |
| Sleeve length | Just before wrist bone; 1/4"–1/2" cuff show | ±1/4" | Adjust via tailor if canvassed |
| Jacket button stance (2-button) | Top button 1–3 fingers above navel | ±1/2" | Visual balance and comfort |
| Jacket length | Covers seat; hem at second thumb knuckle | ±1/2" | Longer can look formal; shorter can look youthful |
| Trouser waist | Comfortable sit without belt | ±1" via alterations | Many RTW pants let out 1–2" |
| Trouser break | Slight to half break | Full break acceptable by style | Avoid excessive bunching |

These targets should appear in product pages and alteration instruction sheets. They align customer expectations, reduce “fit anxiety,” and improve the perceived quality of both RTW and MTM purchases.[^6][^5]

## Appendices

### A. Measurement Conversion Charts and Examples

Table 10. U.S. chest to EU chest conversion (46–50)

| U.S. chest (inches) | EU chest |
|---:|---:|
| 46 | 56 |
| 48 | 58 |
| 50 | 60 |

This conversion is helpful when harmonizing size tables across brands and when customers reference EU labels. Always confirm product-level details because some EU brands use non-numeric sizing for length and fit.[^2]

Table 11. Drop comparison by fit (Classic/Trim/Extra-Trim)

| Fit | Typical drop |
|---|---:|
| Classic/Regular | 6" |
| Trim | 7" |
| Extra-Trim | 8" |

Larger drops complement slimmer jacket silhouettes; however, fit is a holistic choice—customers may prefer a Classic jacket with a slightly slimmer leg. Separates solve this conflict without compromising jacket fit.[^2][^1]

### B. Glossary of Terms

- Chest: Body circumference under the armpits at the fullest part of the chest/shoulder blades; also the jacket size number in U.S. suits.
- Over-arm: Body circumference around the broadest part of shoulders and upper arms.
- Drop (jacket-to-pant): Numeric difference between jacket size and trouser waist; 6-drop is standard for Classic/Regular.
- Rise: The distance from waistband at the crotch to the opposite point; influences sit stance and comfort.
- Center-back length: Body measurement from base of neck to desired jacket hem; used to determine length block.
- Inseam: Inside leg measurement from crotch to hem; drives trouser break and overall length.

### C. Notes on Data Gaps and Brand Variation

Two constraints shape practical sizing tools today:
- Many brands do not publish granular garment measurements for 46R–50R across all fits; Suitsupply, for example, emphasizes fit language and services (Size Passport) over numeric tables for these sizes.[^8][^10]
- Anthropometric datasets mapping height/weight to precise suit measurements are not publicly unified; most available ranges are brand-aggregated rather than population-based. Use chest, over-arm, and length checks to refine, and default to separates when in doubt.[^9]

Given these gaps, the algorithm recommended here privileges chest measurement, over-arm checks, length by height, and the 6-drop as defaults—then allows dynamic overrides for athletic builds, rise preferences, and construction limitations.
