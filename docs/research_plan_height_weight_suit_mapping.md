# Research Plan: Height/Weight to Suit Measurement Mapping for Short Suits

## Objective
Create comprehensive data mapping linking height/weight combinations to specific suit measurements for Short suits (34S-50S)

## Research Components

### 1. Anthropometric Studies and Body Proportions
- [x] 1.1 Search for scientific anthropometric studies on male body measurements
- [x] 1.2 Find data on body proportions across different heights
- [x] 1.3 Locate studies specifically on shorter males (<5'7")
- [x] 1.4 Extract key body proportion ratios and measurements

### 2. Body Type Classifications and Effects
- [x] 2.1 Research slim, regular, broad, athletic body type definitions
- [x] 2.2 Find data on how body types affect specific measurements (chest, waist, shoulders, etc.)
- [x] 2.3 Identify anthropometric differences between body types
- [x] 2.4 Document measurement variations by body type

### 3. Suit Sizing Standards and Short Suit Specifications
- [x] 3.1 Research official suit sizing standards (ASTM, ISO, etc.)
- [x] 3.2 Find data on Short suit sizing (34S-50S)
- [x] 3.3 Locate manufacturer specifications for short suits
- [x] 3.4 Gather historical sizing data and trends

### 4. Height/Weight to Measurement Mapping Data
- [x] 4.1 Search for existing height/weight to suit size mappings
- [x] 4.2 Find body measurement databases
- [x] 4.3 Locate tailoring industry standards and practices
- [x] 4.4 Extract sizing charts from major manufacturers

### 5. Mathematical Modeling Approaches
- [x] 5.1 Research regression models for body measurement prediction
- [x] 5.2 Find anthropometric modeling techniques
- [x] 5.3 Locate statistical approaches for sizing prediction
- [x] 5.4 Review machine learning applications in sizing

### 6. Edge Cases and Special Considerations
- [x] 6.1 Research uncommon body proportions
- [x] 6.2 Find data on sizing challenges and exceptions
- [x] 6.3 Locate information on tailoring adjustments
- [x] 6.4 Document special considerations for shorter individuals

## Data Sources to Investigate
- Scientific journals (anthropometry, ergonomics)
- ASTM/ISO standards organizations
- Tailoring and clothing industry associations
- Government health and sizing databases
- Major suit manufacturers' sizing charts
- Academic research on body proportions
- Statistical modeling papers

## Expected Deliverable
