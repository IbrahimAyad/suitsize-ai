# Regular Suits Height/Weight Measurement Mapping Research Plan

## Objective
Create comprehensive data mapping linking height/weight combinations to specific suit measurements for Regular suits, with comparison to Short suits analysis.

## Research Tasks

### 1. Anthropometric Studies and Body Proportions [✓]
- [✓] 1.1 Search for anthropometric studies on average-height men (5'6"-6'1")
- [✓] 1.2 Extract body proportion data and statistical distributions
- [✓] 1.3 Analyze body measurement correlations with height/weight
- [✓] 1.4 Document frame size variations and statistical significance

### 2. Body Type Variations in Regular Suits [✓]
- [✓] 2.1 Research how different body types affect Regular suit measurements
- [✓] 2.2 Analyze slim, regular, broad, and athletic build variations
- [✓] 2.3 Study proportional adjustments for each body type
- [✓] 2.4 Document measurement offsets and fit modifications

### 3. Height/Weight to Regular Suit Size Mapping [✓]
- [✓] 3.1 Collect brand-specific data for Regular suits (34R-54R)
- [✓] 3.2 Create height/weight range tables for each Regular size
- [✓] 3.3 Analyze statistical correlations and confidence intervals
- [✓] 3.4 Cross-validate with multiple brand datasets

### 4. Mathematical Prediction Models [✓]
- [✓] 4.1 Develop regression models for measurement prediction
- [✓] 4.2 Create height/weight to measurement conversion formulas
- [✓] 4.3 Validate models against anthropometric data
- [✓] 4.4 Build confidence scoring system for predictions

### 5. Regular vs Short Suits Comparison [✓]
- [✓] 5.1 Analyze proportional differences between Regular and Short suits
- [✓] 5.2 Create comparative analysis tables
- [✓] 5.3 Document adjustment factors for length differences
- [✓] 5.4 Study cross-length sizing recommendations

### 6. Data Synthesis and Documentation [✓]
- [✓] 6.1 Integrate all research findings
- [✓] 6.2 Create comprehensive data mapping tables
- [✓] 6.3 Develop implementation guidelines for SuitSize.ai
- [✓] 6.4 Generate final report with recommendations

## Data Sources Strategy
- Anthropometric databases and research papers
- Major menswear brand size charts and measurements
- Professional tailoring guides and industry standards
- Comparative studies on body proportions
- Statistical datasets on height/weight distributions

## Expected Deliverables
1. Anthropometric body proportion analysis
2. Body type variation mapping
3. Height/weight to Regular suit size correlations
4. Mathematical prediction models
5. Regular vs Short suits comparative analysis
6. Implementation recommendations for SuitSize.ai

## Success Criteria
- Complete coverage of all Regular suit sizes (34R-54R)
- Mathematical validation of prediction models
- Clear documentation of body type variations
- Actionable insights for algorithm enhancement
