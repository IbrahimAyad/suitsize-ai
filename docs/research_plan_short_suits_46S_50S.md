# Research Plan: Comprehensive Short Suits Sizing (46S, 48S, 50S) with 6-Drop System

## Task Overview
Research and document comprehensive suit measurements for Short suits sizes 46S, 48S, and 50S with 6-drop system, focusing on industry standards, anthropometric data, tailoring standards, and real-world examples from major brands.

## Research Objectives
1. **Industry-standard body measurements** (chest, waist, hips, shoulders, sleeve length, jacket length)
2. **Anthropometric data** linking height/weight to specific suit measurements
3. **Professional tailoring standards** for slim-cut Short suits
4. **6-drop system mechanics** (pants waist = jacket size - 6)
5. **Real-world sizing examples** from major menswear brands
